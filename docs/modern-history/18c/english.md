# The English 
####
:::details English East India Company (1600-1717)
####
 England too had become impatient to participate in the profitable Asian trade. In 1599, a company to trade with the East was formed under the auspices of a group of merchants known as the Merchant Adventurers. The Company popularly came to be known as the East India Company (or EIC, nickname- John Company). In 1600, The East India Company was granted a royal charter by Queen Elizabeth giving it the exclusive privilege of trading east of the Cape of Good Hope for a period of 15 years. As compared to the Dutch Company, it was a much smaller concern. Its chief asset was its simple organization—a court of 24 directors elected annually by the general court of shareholders. In the beginning, the English Company concentrated on spice trade. The initial voyages of the Company were made to the Spice Islands in Indonesia. Soon the English discovered the importance of Indian goods especially textiles as a barter commodity for spice trade. Thus, in 1608, Surat in Gujarat was established as the trade transit point and the company ships were docked there. The Company now planned to open a factory at Surat in Gujarat and Captain Hawkins was sent

:::details Captain Hawkins (1608)
####
 In 1608, Captain William Hawkins was sent as a representative of the English Company to the Court of Jahangir to obtain permission to open a factory at Surat. Hawkins was the first Englishman to set foot on Indian soil (Surat, 24 August 1608). He could speak Turkish language and he came in a ship named ‘Hector’. He arrived at Surat and from there he went to the court of Jahangir at Agra in 1609. The English Company was given permission by a royal farman to open factories on the west coast. But the English were not satisfied with this concession as they wanted permission for the whole of the country. Moreover, Hawkins had to leave Agra owing to Portuguese intrigue and the English realized that they would first have to deal with the Portuguese before gaining favours from the Mughals.

:::details Early Factories
####
 - In 1611, the English opened their first factory in the south at Masulipatnam (Machilipatnam). In 1611 itself, the English defeated the Portuguese in the Battle of Swally Hole near Surat. This convinced Jahangir and, the English were allowed to set up a permanent factory at Surat in 1613. • In 1615, taking the policy of expansion further, Sir Thomas Roe was sent by King James I as an ambassador to the court of Jahangir. Roe was successful in obtaining royal farman permitting the British to trade and establish factories in all parts of the Mughal Empire. Soon the English began to feel insecure in the absence of fortified settlements and made an attempt to fortify Surat (in 1625) but the Mughals frustrated the attempt and imprisoned the English. The English then decided to shift their focus to South India to avoid direct confrontation with the Mughals. Conditions in South India were more favourable to the English as they did not have to face a strong Indian government there. The great Vijayanagara kingdom had been overthrown in 1565 and its place had taken up by relatively smaller and weaker states.

:::details   Madras (English Factory)
####
• In 1632, Sultan of Golconda issued a Golden Farman in favour of the English, permitting them to trade freely from the ports of Golconda on annual payment of 500 pagodas. • In 1639, Francis Day was able to obtain Madras on lease from the Raja of Chandragiri and shifted the centre of their activity to Madras. The Raja allowed the English to fortify Madras, to administer it and to coin the money on the condition that the English will pay him half the customs revenue of the port. Thus the English set up a factory and built a small fort around it called Fort St. George. • In 1690, the British bought the Fort Devanampatnam, near Madras, and renamed it as Fort St David.

:::details  Bengal (English Factory)
####
• In 1651, at Hugh, the first English factory in Bengal was set up upon receiving permission from Sultan Shuja (second son of Emperor Shah Jahan), the Subahdar of Bengal. In 1658, all establishments of the Company in Bengal, Bihar, Orissa and Coromandel Coast were brought under the control of Fort St. George. • In 1690 Job Charnock established a factory at Sutanuti which was fortified in 1696 and called Fort William. • In 1698 the English Company obtained from Subahdar of Bengal Azim-us-Shan, the zamindari (i.e. right to collect revenue) of the villages of Sutanuti, Kalikataand Gobindapur on payment of Tl,200 to the previous proprietors. In 1700, the Bengal factories were placed under Fort William. Soon the villages grew into a city known as Calcutta

## English and the Mughals
####
:::details Internal Developments of the Company 
Between 1615 and 1686, the company grew from strength to strength. In 1625, the Governors and Directors of the company were given judicial powers. In 1661, the company was empowered to send ships of war with men and ammunition for the safety of its possessions overseas. In 1683, it got full powers to declare war and make peace, to raise and maintain an army. As early as the 1680s, the Company had plans to secure English dominion in India and was determined to make Indians pay for the conquest of their own country. On several occasions, the Court of Directors wrote to the Company authorities advising them to adopt such a civil and military policy that would secure a large revenue and enable the English to maintain their force and make English a nation in India.

:::details Aurangzeb
####
In 1688, hostilities between the English and the Mughal authorities first broke out when the English captured Hugh and declared war on Emperor Aurangzeb. The English had seriously misjudged the situation and underestimated Mughal strength; they were soon defeated and driven out of the factories in Bengal. Realising that they were not yet strong enough to fight the Mughal power, they once again decided to rely on humble entreaties and flattery and get concessions from the Mughal emperor. Aurangzeb too readily pardoned the English for their mistake as he saw that foreign trade benefited Indian artisans and merchants and enriched the state treasury. He therefore permitted them to resume trade on payment of Tl.5 lakh as  compensation.

:::details Farrukhsiyar
####
 In 1717, The East India Company succeeded in securing valuable privileges under a royal farman, Farman of 1717, by the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar. It is also described as the Magna Carta of the Company. The farman was granted because earlier in 1714, William Hamilton, a surgeon in the British East Indian Company had successfully cured Farrukhsiyar of a disease (swelling in the groin). After successful treatment, the Farrukhsiyar finally arranged his marriage to the daughter of Raja Ajit Singh of Jodhpur, which had been delayed by the illness. The farman was instrumental in increasing the Company’s stronghold in Bengal which later colonised Bengal followed by the rest of India.

:::details Provisions of the Farman
 #### 
 The farman confirmed the privileges granted in 1691 and extended them to Gujarat. It contained following provisions: • The British were allowed duty-free trade in Bengal in lieu of an annual payment of ^30,000. • Exemption from payment of all dues at Surat in lieu of one-time settlement of ^10,000. • The Company retained its old privilege of exemption from payment of all dues at Hyderabad and for Madras was required to pay only the existing rent. • The Company was allowed to rent more territory around Calcutta. • The Company was allowed to use their own currency (minted at Bombay) throughout India. • The Company was also granted the right to issue passes or dastaks for the movements of such goods. • The Company’s servants were also permitted to trade but were not covered under this farman and were required to pay the same taxes as Indian merchants. (However, the dastaks were later misused by the Company’s servants to carry out private trade. The Company’s’ servants were paid low salaries and their real income came from the permission the Company granted them to carry on private trade within the country, even as trade between India and Europe was reserved for the Company).

####
:::details Farman as Source of Conflict
####      
 This farman became a perpetual source of conflict between the Company and the Nawabs of Bengal. The strong Nawabs of Bengal such as Murshid Quli Khan and Alivardi Khan objected to the English interpretation of the farman of 1717. They exercised strict control over the English traders and prevented them from misusing the dastaks. Despite strong political control by native rulers, commercial affairs of the company flourished. Madras, Bombay and Calcutta became the nuclei of such activities. Large number of Indian merchants and bankers were attracted to these cities. As far as the company’s servants are concerned, they were keen to take up service in India despite low salaries. This was because they were permitted to carry on private trade in India on payment of same taxes as Indian merchants.
