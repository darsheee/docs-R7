# BRITISH CONQUEST OF BENGAL- PLASSEY TO BUXAR (1757-65)
The beginning of British conquest in India may be traced back to the Battle of Plassey in 1757, in which the English Company’s forces defeated the Nawab of Bengal Siraj-ud-Daulah. In fact, the history of British conquest of Bengal is the history of gradual transfer of power from the Nawabs to the British during the short period of eight years, from 1757 to 1764, the main cause of conflict being the commercial rivalry between the British and the Bengal Nawabs.

:::details Backgrounder
####
- Since the 17th century, Bengal had emerged as a happy hunting ground of the Dutch, the English and the French Companies who were attracted to Bengal mainly owing to its rich resources. • In 1651, at Hugh, the first English factory was set up upon receiving permission from Sultan Shuja (second son of Emperor Shah Jahan), the subahdar of Bengal. • In 1651 itself, Shuja also granted the English East India Company the privilege of free trade in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa in return for lump sum payment of ^3,000 (350 pounds) at a time when the Company’s exports from Bengal were worth more than 50,000 pounds a year. This was because Sultan Shuja was pleased by the services of one Mr. Boughton, who had successfully cured a royal lady of a disease. Thereafter, English factories sprang up at Kasimbazar, Patna and other places. • In 1698, the English Company obtained the zamindari of the villages of Sutanuti, Kalikata and Gobindapur from Subahdar Azim-us-Shan, on payment of ^1,200 to the previous proprietors. In 1700, the Bengal factories were placed under Fort William. Soon the villages grew into a city known as Calcutta. • In 1717, Emperor Farrukhsiyar confirmed the trade privileges granted to the Company by earlier subahdars. By early 18th century, exports from Bengal consisted of nearly 60 per cent of the English Company’s imports from Asia, comprising of products such as cotton and silk textiles, handicrafts and raw products such as saltpeter, rice, indigo and pepper. • In 1717 itself, Farrukhsiyar appointed Murshid Quli Khan, the Diwan of Bengal, as Subahdar or Governor (Nizam or Nazim) of Bengal, thus holding the post of Subahdar and Diwan at the same time. Taking advantage of his position, Murshid Quli now declared himself as the Nawab of Bengal and became the first independent Nawab of Bengal. • . In 1740, Alivardi Khan, the Deputy Governor of Bihar, deposed and killed Nawab Sarfaraz Khan grandson of Murshid Quli). Alivardi Khan rightly did not allow fortifications of French and English factories at Chandernagore and Calcutta. In 1756, Alivardi died, nominating his grandson Siraj-ud-Daulah as his successor.

## Battle of Plassey (23 June 1757)
The English Company first acquired a foothold in Bengal politics through Plassey conspiracy of 1757 which ended the rule of Siraj-ud-Daulah and inaugurated a new phase of British relations with India. Several developments converged to culminate into the Battle of Plassey which marked the beginning of British conquest of India.

####
:::details  Siraj-ud-Daulah (April 1756-June 1757)
####
Siraj’s succession was challenged by two other contenders for the throne, Shaukat Jung (Faujdar of Purnea) and Ghaseti Begum (Alivardi’s daughter). This resulted in intense court factionalism and support was offered to different warring groups by a dominant group in the Nawab’s court comprising Jagat Seth, Umichand (or Amir Chand), Raj Ballabh, Rai Durlabh, Mir Jafar, zamindars and others who were also opposed to Siraj. This seriously destabilised the administration of Bengal and the advantage was taken by English East India Company.
Main reasons for conflict between the Nawab of Bengal and the English Company were: • Farman of 1717: In 1717, the Mughal Emperor Farrukhsiyar issued a farman (royal order) granting the British East India Company many trading privileges. This farman became a perpetual source of conflict between the Bengal Nawabs and the English Company. For one, it meant loss of revenue to the Bengal government and second, dastaks were misused by the Company’s servants to evade taxes on their private trade. • Shelter to Krishna Das: The English Company had given shelter to Krishna Das, son of Raj Ballabh, who had fled with immense treasures against the Nawab’s will. • Support to Ghaseti Begum: The Company had also offended the Nawab by giving support to the claims of Ghaseti Begum.
Immediate Cause: The breaking point came when the English Company, anticipating another round of Anglo-French struggle, began to strengthen the fortifications of Fort William and mounted guns on its walls. Siraj pleaded repeatedly with the English to desist from further fortification, but to no avail. Seeing his own authority flouted in his own dominion, Siraj-ud-Daulah decided to launch an offensive.

:::details Black Hole Tragedy
####
- On 15 June 1756, Siraj-ud-Daulah surrounded Fort William and the siege lasted for five days. During this while, Governor Roger Drake and some of his men escaped through the back door down the Hooghly River, took refuge at Fulta near the sea and waited for help from Madras. They left behind 146 persons, including some women and children, under the command of John Zepahnaih Holwell. After the fort fell on 20 June, the Nawab renamed Calcutta as Alinagar, placed it under the charge of Manik Chand, and himself returned to Murshidabad. Subsequently, Holwell and others were imprisoned in a small room of the fort popularly known as Black Hole (18 feet long and 14 feet 10 inches wide) in conditions of excessive heat and crowding owing to summer solstice. It is believed that out of 146 persons imprisoned in that room, only 26 survived the next morning, the rest were probably trampled down by the others for places near the window. The incident came to be known as the ‘Black Hole Tragedy’. The incident was held up as an example of British heroism and Nawab’s callousness. Siraj-udDaulah was portrayed a cruel monster and held directly responsible for the deaths. The English Company used the episode to sway British public opinion and sympathy in favour of the wars of aggression it intended to wage. Meanwhile, help came from Madras in the form of a strong naval force under the command of Robert Clive. Manik Chand, the Nawab’s officer in charge of Fort William, was bribed and he surrendered after a brief pretence of resistance.

####
:::details Treaty of Alinagar (February 1757)
####
- Consequently, in February 1757, the Nawab had to make peace with the English and sign the humiliating Treaty of Alinagar. As per the treaty, the Nawab had to restore to the English their former privileges of trade, grant permission to fortify Calcutta and even pay compensation amount for the losses suffered by the English. In this way, Clive had regained Calcutta and even forced the Nawab to concede to all English demands. Still, the English were not satisfied. They had decided to replace the Nawab with Mir Jafar. With this in mind, they placed an impossible set of demands before the Nawab, thus making a war inevitable. Clive organised a web of intrigue with the leaders in the Nawab’s court. Chief among these were: • Mir Jafar: the Mir Bakshi (Commander-in-Chief of the Nawab’s army) • Manik Chand: the Officer incharge of Calcutta • Amir Chand: a rich merchant • Jagat Seth: the biggest banker of Bengal • Khadim Khan: commanded a large number of the Nawab.These disaffected nobles of Siraj’s court joined hands with the English to oust Siraj and install their protege, leading to the Plassey Conspiracy of 1757.

####
:::details The Battle (23 June 1757)
####
- On 23 June 1757, both armies met at Plassey, 30 km south of Murshidabad. The English force comprised of 950 European infantry and 2100 Indian sepoys, while that of the Nawab comprised of 50,000 commanded by the treacherous Mir Jafar. Only a small group of Nawab’s soldiers fought bravely. They were led by Mir Madan and Mohan Lai. After Mir Madan was killed by a stray shot from the English side, Mir Jafar played upon the fears of the Nawab and advised him to retire from the battlefield, leaving the command in the hands of his generals. The trick was well played. Once the Nawab retired with 2,000 horsemen, a large part of the Nawab’s army led by Mir Jafar and Rai Durlabh merely looked on, as Clive routed the rest of Nawab’s forces. As a result, the Nawab had to flee but was captured and put to death by an assassin, Mohammad Ali Beg, on the orders of Mir Jafar’s son, Miran.

####
- Mir Jafar was proclaimed as Nawab of Bengal (he was promised the Nawabship by Clive even before the Battle of Plassey). • Robert Clive was confirmed as the Governor of Bengal (Clive’s’ First Governorship: 1757- 60). • The Company was granted undisputed right to free trade in Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. • It was also understood that British officials would no longer need to pay any taxes on their private trade. • The Company received the zamindari of 24-Parganas near Calcutta. • Mir Jafar paid out a sum of ^50 lakh as gift or bribe to the Company’s officials, besides a large amount as personal present to Clive and compensation for the Company’s losses. • All the French settlements in Bengal were surrendered to the English.

:::details Significance of the Battle of Plassey
####
- The battle was hardly significant from the military point of view as the English army showed no military superiority. It was a mere skirmish, resulting in 65 casualties on the English side and 500 on the Nawab’s side. More than the might of the English, it was the treachery of the Nawab’s confidants that decided the fate of the battle of Plassey.

## Battle of Buxar
### Background



####
:::details Mir Jafar (June 1757-October 1760)
####
- Immediately after his succession, Mir Jafar began to face some serious problems- • Some zamindars like Raja Ram Sinha of Midnapore and Hizir Ali Khan of Purnea refused to accept Mir Jafar as their ruler. • Mir Jafar also suspected the loyalty of some of his soldiers, who had not been receiving their regular salary, as well as that of his officials like Rai Durlabh. • There was also an attempt by the Mughal Emperor’s son, who later on became Shah Alam, to capture the throne of Bengal. • Mir Jafar’s growing dependence on the Company for military support was used by the Company to demand more finances and other privileges from the Nawab. But the Nawab failed to meet the growing demands of the Company which brought about his ruin. Mir Jafar, who had played the role of ‘Clive’s Jackal’, soon began to repent the deal he had struck and in order to shed off the British yoke, Jafar began intriguing with the Dutch against the British. Clive, however, thwarted this design by defeating the Dutch in the decisive Battle of Bedra (November 1759). But by now the English Company had grown considerably suspicious of the Nawab and had begun to look for a suitable replacement. From the Company’s perspective, its role had considerably changed since Plassey, and it now had to play the role of a commercial-cum military-cum political power. How was it going to fund its new responsibilities? The Nawab was unable to pay the stipulated payments and by 1760, he was in debt to the Company to the tune of ?25 lakh. The Company had lost its confidence on Mir Jafar. Meanwhile, Mir Jafar’s son, Miran, died and once again conflict over succession followed. The conflict was between Miran’s son and Mir Qasim, the son-in-law of Mir Jafar. Mir Qasim secretly promised Vansittart (who had succeeded Clive as the Governor of Bengal in 1760) the necessary funds if the English Company agreed to support his claims to the Nawabship. Accordingly, Vansittart decided to take the side of Mir Qasim and in October 1760, Mir Jafar was ultimately forced to abdicate in favour of his son-in-law, Mir Qasim. In this way, Mir Jafar sowed as he had reaped, got betrayal in return for betrayal.

:::

####
:::details  Mir Qasim or Itmad-ud- Daulah (October 1760-63)
####
- Mir Qasim rewarded his benefactors by granting the Company the zamindari of Burdwan, Midnapore and Chittagong. He promised to give the Company half the share in chunam trade of Sylhet. He also heavily bribed his kingmakers namely, Vansittart, Holwell and other English officials with handsome presents totalling 29 lakh rupees. The first few months of Mir Qasim’s reign went very well. But soon the relationship with the British embittered due to several reasons. But Mir Qasim belied English hopes. He was able and efficient ruler and wanted to free himself from foreign control. • He shifted the capital from Murshidabad to Monghyr in Bihar, away from the influence of the Company at Calcutta and court intrigues of Murshidabad. • He also majorly overhauled the bureaucracy by men of his choice and sought to improve the finances of the state. • He sought to modernise his army along European lines and preparations were made for the manufacture of guns at Monghyr. • Ram Narayan, the Deputy Governor of Bihar, had shown refractory behaviour since the days of Mir Jafar and continued to do so, banking on English support as he had received in the past. In spite of repeated reminders, he failed to submit the accounts of Bihar. In fact, this time he went on to proclaim himself as independent ruler. Mir Qasim decided not to tolerate such open defiance of his authority and ordered his dismissal and execution. • The misuse of the Company’s dastaks for private trade was a perpetual cause of tension between the English Company and the Nawab. The Company’s servants were not paying any duty on their goods, whereas the local merchants had to pay duty with the following consequences: ■ The Nawab lost tax revenue
Further, the Company’s servants even sold the dastaks to Indian merchants for a commission. • The Company’s servants were not even content with duty free trade and used coercive methods to get things at cheaper rate. They ignored the officials of the Nawab and forcibly took away the goods and commodities of the peasants and merchants for a fourth part of their value. They also used violence and oppression to force the peasants into buying goods at prices many times higher their value. In such conditions, though Mir Qasim did not seek independence from the British, he did seek to limit the fast expanding encroachments of the English on his jurisdiction, which were driving him to desperation. He wrote a letter to the Governor Vansittart and pleaded with him for justice and reason. Following the receipt of the desperate plea, Vansittart and Warren Hastings, another member of the Calcutta Council, met the Nawab at Monghyr and concluded a compromise. It was agreed that the Nawab would give the English traders a share in the inland trade provided they paid 9% duty. It was also agreed that the Nawab alone would be competent to grant dastaks and his authority would be ultimate in the resolution of disputes regarding trade. Unfortunately, the agreement was disproved by the Calcutta Council. Most of the Council members themselves participated in inland trade and instead of the compromise they rather favoured the deposition of Mir Qasim, which would provide them with yet another opportunity for receiving bribes. Out of desperation, Mir Qasim abolished all inland duties to bring the Indian merchants on the same footing as the English, provoking hostilities by an attack on Patna town. In this way, war between the Nawab and the English broke out in 1763 and the Nawab was defeated in a series of battles that year. Subsequently, he fled to Awadh and formed an alliance with Shuja-ud-Daulah (Nawab of Awadh) and Shah Alam II (the fugitive Mughal Emperor) in a final bid to overthrow the English.

####
:::details The Battle
Immediate Cause: The abuse of dastaks (duty free trade permits) by the Company’s servants for their private trade became the immediate cause of the war of 1764.
- The three allies clashed with the Company’s army at the battlefield of Buxar on 22 October 1764. The allies’ forces stood at nearly 40,000 to 60,000, whereas the English forces stood at nearly 7,000 commanded by Major Munro. It was a closely contested battle with heavy casualties on both sides and ended in the victory of the  superior military power, the British.
- This was one of the most decisive battles in Indian history. It firmly established the British as masters of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa. Awadh was placed at their mercy.

- Buxar sealed the fate of the Bengal Nawabs and, for all practical purposes, power was transferred into the hands of the English Company. • Mir Jafar was brought back to the throne of Bengal, this time on much harsher terms. Mir Jafar agreed to hand over the districts of Midnapore, Burdwan and Chittagong to the English and permitted them duty free trade in Bengal (with the exception of 2% duty on salt). He and his successors had to pay lakh per month to the English Company, allow Company’s intervention in matters of appointments and reduce military establishments. • Mir Jafar died shortly thereafter and his minor son, Najim-ud- Daulah was appointed as Nawab. • Clive was resent as Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Bengal (Clive’s Second governorship: 1765-67). First and foremost, he took up the tasks of defining relations with the defeated powers and showed considerable practical wisdom in his settlements with them

:::details  Settlement with Nawab of Awadh:
####
- Clive went to Awadh, met Shuja-ud-Daula at Allahabad and concluded with him the First Treaty of Allahabad (16 August 1765). As per the treaty, ■ The Nawab of Awadh was made to pay a war indemnity of ?50 lakh to the Company. ■ The Nawab was made to surrender Allahabad and Kora to Emperor Shah Alam and confirm Balwant Singh, the zamindar of Banaras, to his estate.
- The Nawab was made to enter an offensive and defensive treaty (subsidiary alliance) with the Company. The Company promised to support the Nawab against an outside attack, provided he paid for the services of the troops. In this way, the Nawab of Awadh became dependent on the Company. (In this way, Clive did not annex Awadh since annexing would have placed the Company under an obligation to protect extensive land frontier, which was vulnerable to attack by the Afghans under Ahmad Shah Abdali and the Marathas. Instead, Clive converted Awadh into a friendly buffer state between the British territories in Bengal and the Maratha possessions).

####
:::details  • Settlement with Mughal Emperor, Shah Alam II:
####
- Clive concluded the Second Treaty of Allahabad (August 1765) with the Mughal Emperor Shah Alam II. As per the treaty: ■ The Emperor was taken into Company’s protection and given the districts of Kora and Allahabad ceded by Awadh (the Emperor resided in the fort of Allahabad for 6 years as a virtual prisoner of the English). ■ In return, the Emperor issued a farman dated 12 August 1765 granting to the Company the Diwani (right to collect revenue) of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa in return for the Company making an annual payment of ^26 lakh to him and providing for the expenses of the Nizamat of Bengal, Bihar and Orissa which was fixed at ^53 lakh. (In this way, the farman legalized the Company’s gain in Bengal; it established a ‘dual system’ in Bengal in theory and converted the Emperor into a useful ‘rubber stamp’ of the Company).
:::



####
:::details Settlement with Nawab of Bengal:
####
- After the death of Mir Jafar, Najm-ud- Daulah was allowed to succeed his father (February 1765) on the following conditions: ■ The Nawab would surrender Defence and Foreign Affairs (both were nizamat functions) into the hands of the Company and civil administration into the hands of a Naib-Subahdar nominated by the Company and not removable without their consent. ■ (Clearly, the Company gained Diwani from the emperor and nizamat functions from the Nawab of Bengal. In this way, the infamous dual system was ‘dual’ only in theory; while in practice the Company acquired all real power in Bengal. The Nawab lost all independent military or financial power and became a mere figurehead).
:::



####
:::details Dual System of Administration established in Bengal
####
- In theory, Dual System meant the system of governance where the Company exercised Diwani functions (revenue collection) while the Nawab of Bengal exercised the Nizamat functions (defence, law and order and administration of justice). However, Njam ud-Daulah was allowed to succeed as Nawab of Bengal only on the condition that he surrendered the Nizamat functions. Hence, in reality, the ‘dual system’ was only a sham as it was the Company that exercised all political power and merely used the Nawab and his administration as an instrument for its purposes. Thus, in practice, the dual system referred to the system of government whereby the Company acquired all real power while the ‘responsibility’ for administration rested on the shoulders of the Nawab. A fatal divorce of power from responsibility was inherent in this dual system. • The advantage of this system was that the British had power without responsibility. This  had adverse consequences for the people of Bengal, as neither the Company nor the Nawab cared for their welfare. In the words of Clive himself, ‘Such a scene of anarchy, confusion, bribery, corruption and extortion was never seen or heard of in any country but Bengal/ • Thus, began the drain of wealth from Bengal. The Company stopped sending money from England to buy Indian goods. These goods were now purchased from the revenues of Bengal and sold abroad. • This drain of wealth greatly impoverished Bengal and was a major factor responsible for the terrible Bengal famine of 1770. Though the famine was caused by failure of rains, its devastating effects were accentuated by the Company’s policies. • The Company had to pay a handsome sum per year to the British Government as its share of the rich prize
:::


####
:::details Why did Clive go for Dual System?
####
- Clive wanted to maintain Nawab as a shadow authority which the Company should seem to venerate. Open assumption of authority would have shown the true colours of the Company and might have resulted in uniting Indian princes against it. • The Company did not wish to generate England’s interest regarding the functioning of the Company. It wanted to avoid interference of the British Parliament. • It was also doubtful whether other European companies would acknowledge the Company’s subahship and pay duties that they paid to Nawabs of Bengal. • Open assumption of political power would have attracted the attention of other European powers. • The Company did not have adequate personnel to run the administration of Bengal. • Directors of the Company were more interested in financial and commercial gains rather than territorial acquisitions. A dual system would serve the Company’s interests well. As a result of the system of Dual Government, the English Company acquired real power without any responsibility while the position of Nawab was virtually reduced to a cipher.
:::


####
:::details Adverse Impact of Dual System
####
- The dual system proved to be a total failure and had the following evil effects: • It led to complete breakdown of administration and law and order in Bengal. While the Nawab had no real power to enforce law, the Company also shunned all responsibility in this regard. • Bengal, once the granary of India, now faced the specter of famines. The Company appointed two Naib-Diwans, Mohammad Reza Khan and Raja Sitab Roy for Bengal and Bihar respectively, and directed them to collect as high revenue as possible (Reza Khan was also the Naib-Nazim). The Bengal peasant faced some of the worst exactions by the revenue officials and many of them ran away into the jungles or simply joined the ranks of the robbers. Clearly, the Company’s policies in Bengal greatly contributed to the terrible Bengal famine of 1770. • Dual government led to disruption of trade and commerce in Bengal. The Company’s merchants exercised strict monopoly and would undersell the Indian merchants in Bengal, pushing many of them into destitution and beggary. • It also ruined indigenous industry and skill. The Company used its political power to compel the cotton weavers of Bengal to buy raw material from and sell woven cloth to the Company exclusively at arbitrary prices. The Company also encouraged the industries selectively. For instance, as per an order of 1769, the Company was asked to encourage production of raw silk but discourage woven silk fabrics as they competed with silk fabrics manufactured in England. Even the Company’s factories where raw silk was produced, the silk winders were compelled to work under oppressive conditions; many even cut-off their thumbs to escape the miseries of factory life, e The Company’s avaricious policies in Bengal vitiated the entire atmosphere and led to an overall moral degradation and decay of Bengal society. The Indian servants of the Company followed the example of their corrupt masters. The peasants and artisans, unsure of receiving fair price for their labour, lost incentive for good work.
