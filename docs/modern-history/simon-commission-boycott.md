# Simon-Commission & Simon Boycott Movement (1927-29)
## 1927

####
:::details Simon Commission
- As per a provision of the Government of India Act 1919, an Indian Statutory Commission (or a Royal Commission) was to be appointed at the end of 10 years (i.e. in 1929) after the passing of the Act, to enquire into the working of the Government of India under the Act Of 1919 and suggest fresh reforms.
- In other words, the commission was appointed to consider under the terms of the Government of India Act of 1919, whether India was fit to receive a further instalment of constitutional government.
- Lord Birkenhead, secretary of State for India, named the Indian Statutory Commission, or Simon Commission, to review the impact of the Montagu -Chelmsford Reforms.
-  The Commission's membership included: Sir John Simon  as its Chairman, Clement Attlee, Edward Cadogan, George Lane-Fox, Vernon Hartshorn, Donald Howard, Harry Levy-Lawson.
-  Simon and the commission's members paid a preliminary visit to India. The idea of forming a joint select committee with Indian members came to nothing.

:::details Why was Simon Commission appointed before time?
-  The Commission was appointed on 8th November 1927, two years in advance of the prescribed time. Why was it so?
-  The British government had declared that it was doing so on account of its liberal attitude towards India.
-  In reality, the reasons lay elsewhere:
   -  Firstly, the political situation in Britain compelled the conservative Tory government to appoint the commission earlier. In 1927, the Tory Government of Britain was facing the prospect of electoral defeat at the hands of the Labor Party (as elections were due in 1929) and suddenly decided that it could not leave an important issue as the issue of India, Britain's most important colony, in the hands of an inexperienced Labor Party.
   -  Secondly, the Tory government also wanted to send the delegation at a time when communal situation had deteriorated so that the Commission sees India unfit for fresh instalment of constitutional government.
   -  Thirdly, the nationalist opinion in India also resented the method of periodic enquiry and had been demanding a complete revision of the constitutional system. The Indian nationalists had already declared the constitutional reforms of 1919 as inadequate and had been demanding an early reconsideration of the constitutional question. British government also wanted to divert the attention of nationalist Indians from a widespread agitation that was gathering momentum.
   -  It is also believed that the early appointment of the commission was a result of the pressure created by the Swaraj Party and the youth activities led by Nehru and Bose. Yet another opinion is that the Commission was used as a bargaining counter to divide the Swaraj Party.

 :::details Lord Birkenhead Challenges the Indians
 - Lord Birkenhead, the then Secretary of State, justified the exclusion of Indians from Simon Commission on the plea that there were vital differences among various Indian political parties and then threw a challenge to Indians to produce a constitution acceptable to all sections of Indian society.

:::
 ####
 :::details Delhi Proposals (December 1927)
 - With the aim of bridging the gulf between the Congress and the Muslim League and to enable them to present a common set of demands before the British, a group of prominent Muslim leaders met at Delhi in December 1927 with MA Jinnah presiding over the session.
 - In a dramatic move, the leaders agreed to forego separate electorates, the first and the last time the League agreed to do so, if their four proposals were met.
 - The proposals came to be known as Delhi proposals and included the following points:
   - 1. Sind should be separated from Bombay presidency as a separate province (Muslim majority province).
   - 2. In NWFP and Baluchistan, reforms were to be carried out on the same lines as in other provinces, i.e. they should be treated constitutionally on the same footing as other provinces.
   - 3. Muslim representation in Central legislature should be either one-third of the total or more than that.
   - 4. Representation in Punjab and Bengal should be made on the basis of population (to ensure Muslim majority in the legislature) and in other provinces, where Muslims were a minority, the existing reservation of seats for Muslims should continue.
 - During the Madras Congress Session of December 1927, the Congress passed a resolution accepting most of the demands of Delhi Proposals.
 - However, the Muslim League split over the issue and a separate annual session of the League was held at Lahore under the presidentship of Sir Mian Muhammad Shafi, worsening the communal situation in India.
 - The Congress proposals came next in the form of Nehru Report.

:::
 ####
 :::details  All Parties Conference (presided by Dr. MA Ansari, February 1928)
- The Indians accepted the challenge and the representatives of the Congress as well as other organizations such as Muslim League, Hindu Mahasabha, etc., met at a conference in February 1928 which came to be known as the All Parties Conference.
-  In the conference, it was decided that while framing the constitution; the principle of **full Dominion responsible government** should be kept in mind.
-  The Madras Congress had earlier adopted the goal of complete independence, yet at the All Parties Conference 'fully responsible government based on the model of self- governing Dominions' was accepted as the desired aim.
-  This was done to gain support of all those organizations which aimed at Dominion status and rally them behind a common plan.
:::
 ####
 :::details Nehru Report
- In May 1928, the All Parties Conference (Bombay, presided by Dr. MA Ansari) appointed a sub- committee headed by Motilal Nehru to draft a constitution.
- Thus, the Nehru Committee was the Indian response to the appointment of Simon Commission and to the challenge of Birkenhead.
:::

:::details Members of the Nehru Committee
-   Motilal Nehru (Chairman), Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru, Sir Ali Iman, MS Aney, Mangal Singh, Shuab Quereshi, GR Pradhan and Subhas Chandra Bose.
-   In August 1928, the committee's report, famously known as Nehru Report or Nehru Committee Report, was finalised and adopted.
-   The Nehru Report firmly laid down that full responsible government was not to be considered as a remote step but as an immediate step, as opposed to the principle of gradual advancement envisaged by the Act of 1919.
:::


:::details Main Recommendations
- The main recommendations of the Nehru Report were as follows:
  - **Dominion Status**: India should have the same constitutional status in the British Empire as other Dominions with Parliament having powers to make laws and should be known as the Commonwealth of India.
  - Safeguards and Guarantees for Minority:
    -  It recommended that the proposed constitution should provide for liberty of conscience and religion.
    - New provinces on linguistic basis to be created.
    - On the principle of self-determination, the Muslim majority provinces should be given distinct politico-cultural identity, i.e. Sind was to be separated from Bombay Presidency and NWFP was to be given full provincial status.
    -  It rejected separate communal electorates and recommended that elections should be held on the basis of joint electorates subject to reservations of seats for Muslims in centre and in those provinces where they were in a minority (and not where they were in a numerical majority), and for non-Muslims in NWFP
    -  Later the committee added two additional recommendations—communal representation was to be reconsidered after 10 years and Baluchistan was to be given full provincial status. <br>
 -  **Fundamental Rights:** The constitution should define citizenship and declare fundamental rights. The Report recommended 19 Fundamental Rights including universal adult suffrage, equal rights for women, freedom to form unions and dissociation of the state form religion in any form.
 -  ** Responsible Government:** It recommended responsible government at centre and in provinces.
 -  **Bicameral Parliament:** The legislative powers should invest with the King and bicameral parliament, and executive powers with the King exercisable by the Governor General. Same provisions should be made for the establishment of responsible governments in provinces in respect of governors and executive councils. It suggested that Indian Parliament should consist of a) The Senate elected for 7 years, containing 200 members elected by the Provincial Councils, and b) the House of Representatives consisting of 500 members for 5 years through adult franchise. The Governor General (to be appointed by the British Government but paid out of Indian revenues) was to act on the advice of the Executive Council which was to be collectively responsible to the Parliament. Similarly, Provincial Councils were to be elected on the basis of adult franchise for 5 years and the Governor was to act on the advice of the Provincial Executive Council.
 -  **Hierarchy of Courts:** Hierarchy of courts with Supreme Court at its apex should be established.
 -  **Federal Government:** It recommended, for the first time, that India should be a federation on the basis of linguistic provinces and provincial autonomy but residual powers with the centre. That's why some scholars consider the Nehru Report proposal as unitary rather than federal.

The Nehru Report contained virtually no federal features. Though federal principle was introduced in the composition of the senate, the provinces were not equally represented in it. Decentralisation was carried to the same extent as in the Act of 1919. Residuary powers were vested in the centre. The position of princely states with relation to centre was also not made clear.
:::

:::details Status of Princely States
- The Nehru Committee faced a complex problem with regard to the status of princely states. In 1927, the subjects of Princely states had formed the State Peoples Conference with the objective of introducing self-governing institutions. The Princes felt threatened and sought the help of the British who appointed a committee under the chairmanship of Sir Harcourt Butler to look into the issue.
- The **Butler Committee** laid stress on the preservation of Princely states through British Paramountcy. The appointment of Butler Committee was criticised by the Nehru Committee which advocated that all rights and obligations of the Paramountcy should be transferred to the government of Commonwealth of India and that conflicts between the Commonwealth of India and Indian states should be resolved by the Supreme Court.
- A number of leading princes now supported the formation of a federation. They detested the doctrine that 'Paramountcy was paramount'. They aimed to be completely free from every external influence so far as the internal affairs of the State were concerned. This they thought would be facilitated by an 'All India Federation'.

:::


:::details Concessions to Hindu Communalists in Nehru Report
- These included the following features:
- Joint electorates everywhere but reservation of seats for Muslims only where in minority.
-  Sind to be separated from Bombay presidency only after the grant of dominion status and subject to weightage to Hindu minority in Sind.
-  Political structure proposed was broadly unitary as residual powers were vested with the centre.
:::


:::details Significance of Nehru Report
-  Its most significant contribution was that it was the first and frankest attempt by Indians to face the problem of communalism and express an organised opinion of majority of Indian leadership on the communal problem. It clearly stated that the only way of giving a feeling of security to the minority was by providing for safeguards and guarantees.
:::


:::danger All Parties Conference Fails to pass the Nehru Report
- In December 1928, All Parties Conference was held at Calcutta.
- The Conference failed to pass the Report as objections were raised by the Muslim League, the Hindu Mahasabha and the Sikh League.
- The incompatibility between the League and the Mahasabha complicated matters and frustrated all attempts at unity.
- A section of League and Khilafatists were willing to accept the Nehru Report provided three amendments, proposed by Jinnah, were accepted. Two of these were the same as the third and fourth demands in the Delhi proposals (as the first two demands had been accepted by the Nehru Report). The third and fresh demand was that the residuary powers be vested in the provinces.

:::



:::details  Amendments Proposed by Jinnah (Calcutta Amendments)
- Muslim representation in Central legislature should be either one-third of the total or more than that.
- Representation in Punjab and Bengal should be made on the basis of population (to ensure Muslim majority in the legislature) and in other provinces, where Muslims were a minority, the existing reservation of seats for Muslims should continue.
- Residuary powers should be vested with the provinces.
:::


:::details Muslim League Rejects Nehru Report
- Main objections of the Muslim League were:
  - While the 1916 Congress: Muslim League agreement provided separate electorates and weightage to the Muslim community, they were rejected by the Nehru Report.
  -  The Muslims realised that while they would be a majority in the provinces of the North- East and North-West of India, and hence would control their provincial legislatures, they would always be a minority at the Centre. Thus, they demanded, in contrary to the Nehru Report, that residuary powers go to the provinces.

- As the abovementioned demands of Jinnah were not accepted at the All Parties Conference, he parted ways and joined the groups led by Aga Khan and Muhammed Shafi.
- Thus, the Nehru Report was rejected by Jinnah, and had the following consequences:
  - 1. Jinnah rejected the Nehru Report calling it 'Parting of the Ways' with the Congress and once the "Ambassador of Hindu-Muslim Unity" was now convinced that the Hindu mindset in India was bent upon pushing the Muslim minority to the wall.
  - 2. On 1st  January 1929, an All India Muslim Conference was held in Delhi and it passed a resolution emphasising two principles. Firstly, it said that since India was a vast country with substantial diversity, it required a federal system of government in which the states would have complete autonomy and residuary powers. Secondly, the system of separate electorates for Muslims should continue as long as their rights and interests were not safeguarded in the constitution.
  - 3. In March 1929, Jinnah formulated his **Fourteen Points** which became the text of communal demands and included-federal government, separate electorates, reservation for Muslims in legislatures, reservation of Jobs for Muslims, creation of new Muslim majority provinces, etc.).
:::

:::details Jinnah's Fourteen Points (March 1929)
Jinnah formulated the "Fourteen Points" for safeguarding the rights and in terests of the Muslims in any future constitution of the country. He further clarified that no constitution would be acceptable to the Muslims, unless it conformed to those fourteen points (which were basically a reiteration of Jinnah's objections to the Nehru Report). These were:
  - 1. **Federal constitution:** The form of the future constitution should be Federal, with the residuary power vested in the provinces.
  - 2. **Provincial Autonomy:** A Uniform measure of the autonomy shall be granted to all provinces.
  - 3. **Effective representation of minorities:** All legislatures in the country and other elected bodies shall be constituted on the definite principle of adequate and effective representation of minorities in every province without reducing the majority in any province to minority or even equality.
  - 4. **Muslim Representation in the Central legislature:** In the Central legislature, Muslim representation shall not be less than one-third.
  - 5. **Separate Electorates:** Representation of the communal groups shall continue to be by separate electorates provided that it shall be open to any community at any time to abandon its separate electorate in favour of the joint electorates.
  - 6. **Protection of Muslim majority in provinces:** Any terrestrial redistribution that might at any time be necessary shall not in any way affect the Muslim majority in Punjab, Bengal and NWFP.
  - 7. **Religious Liberty:** Full religious liberty that is liberty of belief, worship and observance, propaganda, association and education shall be guaranteed to all communities.
  - 8. **Communal Veto:** No bill or resolution or any part thereof shall be passed in any legislature or any other elected body if three-fourth of the members of any community in that particular body oppose it as being injurious to that of the community.
  - 9. **Separation of Sindh from Bombay Presidency:** Sind should be separated from the Bombay Presidency.
  - 10. **Reforms in NWFP and Baluchistan:** Reforms should be made in the NWFP and Baluchistan.
  - 11. **Representation of Muslims in the Services:** Provision should be made in the Constitution giving Muslims an adequate share along with the other Indians in all the services of the State and Local self-governing bodies having due regard to the requirements of effciency.
  - 12. **Constitutional safeguards for Muslims:** The Constitution should embody adequate safeguards to the protection of the Muslim Culture, education, language, religion, personal laws, and Muslim charitable institutions. They should get their due share in grant-in-aid.
  - 13. **Muslim representation in Cabinet:** No cabinet, either central or provincial, should be formed without there being at least one-third of the Muslim Ministers.
  - 14. No change shall be made in the constitution by the Central legislature except with the concurrence of the states constituting the Indian Federation.
:::


:::details Nehru and Bose also criticized the Nehru Report:
-  Within the Congress itself, young nationalists led by J. Nehru and SC Bose also objected to the Nehru Report because of its acceptance of Dominion Status.
-   Their slogan was 'Complete Independence or Purna Swaraj' and even the Congress had earlier (in Madras session 1927) adopted the goal of complete independence but later it made a compromise and accepted Dominion status as its goal in order to rally all parties behind a common plan.
-   In August 1928, the 'Independence of India League' was launched by J. Nehru with the support of Subhas Bose (Nehru and Bose as secretaries and S. Srinivas Iyengar as President), as a pressure group within the Congress with the aim of
    -    Countering the concept of Dominion Status
    -    Pleading for complete independence of India from the British, and
    -   Working for establishment of an Indian Republic on Socialist lines
:::

## 1928

:::details Congress gives Ultimatum to Government (Calcutta Session)
- During the Congress Session at Calcutta, December 1928 (presided by Motilal Nehru), a large number of delegates led by Jawaharal Nehru, Subhas Bose and Satyamurthy pressed for Poorna Swaraj as the goal of the Congress.
- The older leaders such as Gandhiji and Motilal Nehru felt that unity over dominion status had been arrived at with great difficulty and could not be given away in haste and that the government should be given a grace period to accept the Nehru Report.

Finally, the Congress resolved in one voice that in case the government did not accept the Nehru Report by 31 sr December 1929, the Congress would declare complete independence as its goal and would also launch a civil disobedience movement to achieve that goal.
<br>

Preparations now began for a second round of mass action to achieve complete independence-
  - With this, the council entry program of the Swaraj Party faded into irrelevance and it now merged with the Congress.
  -  Gandhi, now in his sixties, cancelled his Europe tour and instead decided to continue with his mass contact touts within India and prepare them for direct political action (Ever since his release from jail, Gandhiji had been touring the country incessantly).
  -  At Gandhiji's insistence, the CWC formed a Foreign Cloth Boycott Committee to carry out an aggressive program of boycott of foreign cloth and its public burning.<br>

Some other events also kept the political environment of the country stirred. Such as:
  -  On 20th March 1929, the government arrested 31 labour leaders and took them to Meerut for trial.
  -  On 8th April 1929, Bhagat Singh and BK Dutt of HSRA threw harmless bombs in the Central Legislative Assembly and were arrested. While in jail, Jatin Das, a member of HSRA died fasting, throwing the whole country into a fit of mourning and turmoil.
:::

:::details LABOUR GOVERNMENT COMES TO POWER IN BRITAIN (MAY 1929)
In May 1929, Labour Party headed by Ramsay MacDonald came to power in Britain. The effective boycott of the Simon Commission had opened many eyes and Viceroy Irwin was called to London for deliberations. Upon his return to India, Irwin famously declared on 31 't October 1929 that as per the new government, natural progression to Dominion Status is implicit in Montagu Declaration of 1917. He also gave assurance of Round Table Conference to enlist the concurrence of all sections in India, as soon as the Simon Commission submitted its report.
:::



:::details DELHI MANIFESTO (2ND NOVEMBER 1929)
Two days later, major national leaders met and issued the Delhi manifesto, demanding that the purpose of Round Table Conference should not be to discuss when Dominion Status would be granted, but to draft a scheme for its implementation. Even though the Viceregal statement was welcomed all round, it soon became a subject of much controversy in the British Parliament. The trend of discussion in the House of Commons showed that the British were against giving Dominion Status to India.


On 23rd December 1929, Irwin, reversing his previous stand, himself told Gandhiji and other leaders that he was unable to give any such assurance. With this, the grace period of one year for the government was over. The stage was now set for another round of confrontation and mass action.

 :::details Congress Adopts Purna Swaraj as Goal
- On 31st December 1929, the annual session of the Congress was held at Lahore, the capital city of Punjab.
- It was presided over by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru (son had now succeeded the father, marking a unique family tradition).
-  Nehru gave a stirring speech, declaring Purna Swaraj as the goal for India and calling upon all his countrymen and countrywomen to join the non-violent mass struggle against the foreign rule.
-   In this way, the session also announced the launching of a civil disobedience movement, though the program of struggle was not drawn and was left to Gandhiji (later the Working Committee Meeting at Sabarmati Ashram and invested Gandhiji with all powers to launch the Civil Disobedience Movement at a time and place of his choice).


At midnight on 315t December 1929, on the banks of the River Ravi, Jawaharlal Nehru hoisted the newly adopted tricolour amidst mixed feelings of jubilation and grim resolve.

Note: Nehru became the president of the Lahore session on the insistence of Gandhiji, despite only 3 of the 18 Provincial Congress Committees supporting him. He insisted that, "the battle of the future has to be fought by younger men and women. Responsibility will sober and mellow the youth and prepare them for the burden they must discharge. Pandit Jawaharlal has everything to recommend him."

## 1930

 ####
 :::details Independence Pledge (26th January 1930)
- The Congress decided to celebrate 26th January 1930 as the first Independence Day or Purna Swaraj Day, holding public meetings all over the country and taking Independence Pledge, drafted by Gandhiji.
- This program of the Congress met with great success. In towns and villages, small and big, the pledge was read out in local lahguage and national flag hoisted.

 ####
 :::details Report of the Simon Commission (7th June 1930)
 - The Simon Commission issued its two-volume report regarding findings and recommendations about India.
 - It promoted a concept of provincial autonomy, a central legislative assembly elected by the provincial legislatures, and provided no protections to the Muslims.
 - The Report found little favor with either the Indians or the British.
-  It recommended the following:
   -   The establishment of responsible government at the centre was to wait indefinitely i.e. it was to be established sometime in the future.
   -   Retention of separate electorates.
   -    Reservation of seats for depressed classes.
   -   Federal government in India in order to cope with the diversity of the country. However, the all-India federation was not considered practical idea for immediate execution.
   -   Abolition of Dyarchy in the provinces and establishment of responsible unitary government in the provinces.
   -   Retention of the special powers of the Governors for the safety and tranquility of the provinces and for the protection of the minorities. They would also have full powers of intervention in the event of breakdown of the constitution.
   -   Extension of franchise and expansion of legislatures.
   -   Separation of Burma from British India.


In this way, the commission recommended provincial autonomy in India but rejected Parliamentary responsibility at the centre, ignoring the national demand for a responsible government at the Centre. Overall, it was not a constitutional scheme which deserved any detailed examination and was rejected by almost all Indian parties and the Indian people enthusiastically participated in the Civil Disobedience Movement.
:::

####
:::details  Lord Irwin Statement
- 31 Oct. 1929. Lord Irwin announced on behalf of the British Government that the natural constitutional progress ofindiawas the attainment of Dominion Status. The Viceroy did not name a specific time for the award. The Congress Party indicated Its willingness to cooperate in formulating a Dominion constitution as a test of the government's sincerity which in the end proved minimal. In November debates in both Houses, the measure was tacitly approved, but in such  away that Congress rejected the Declaration
- 23 Dec. 1929. Lord Irwin met with Gandhi, Jawahar1al Nehru , Vallabhbjai Patel , Mohammed Ali Jinnah , and Tel Bahadur Sapru at New DeIhl but could not arrive at an agreement for framing a constitution under Dominion Status. The Congress also refused to attend the London Round Table Conference in London due to communal division and the lack of British support for Indian freedom. At the ensuing 1930 annual meeting of the Congress Party held at Lahore, the Congress declared itself for independence rather than Dominion Status and authorized a campaign of civil disobedience.
