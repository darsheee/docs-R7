The Civil Disobedience Movement was the next mass movement launched by the Congress after a gap of 8 years and on the withdrawal of Non-cooperation Movement in February 1922. There were several factors that prepared the ground for the CDM, starting from the sudden withdrawal of the Non-Cooperation movement to the non-acceptance of Nehru Report by the British government.

## RUN UP TO CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT (CDM)

:::details Calcutta Session of Congress (December 1928)
- You may recall that during the Congress Session at Calcutta in December 1928, the Congress had given an ultimatum to the British government and had resolved in one voice that in case the government did not accept the Nehru Report by 31st December 1929, the Congress would declare complete independence as its goal and would also launch a civil disobedience movement to achieve that goal.

:::details  1 Lahore Session of Congress (December 1929)
- On the expiry of this grace period, on 31st December 1929, during the annual session of the Congress held at Lahore, the Congress declared Purna Swaraj as its goal and announced the launching of a civil disobedience movement under Gandhiji. In mid-February 1930, the Working Committee met at Sabarmati Ashram and invested Gandhiji with all powers to launch the Civil Disobedience Movement, at a time and place of his choice.

:::details Gandhi's Eleven Points (January 1930)
- However, Gandhi was not sure about his plan of action and tried to negotiate with the government once again before launching the movement. He formulated "Eleven Points" of administrative reforms and placed them before Lord Irwin in a letter dated 31st January 1930. He insisted that there would be no need for any agitation if his eleven points were agcepted, which constituted for him the substance of purna swaraj. The Eleven Points included the following:
  -  1. Abolition of Salt Tax and also the government's salt monopoly
  -  2. Reduction of the Rupee Sterling ratio
  -  3. Reduction of Land revenue by half and it be subjected to legislative control
  -  4. Reduction of Salaries of highest grade services by half
  -  5. Reduction of military and civil service expenditure by half
  -  6. Protection for Indian textiles (protective tariff) and coastal shipping
  -  7. Discharge of all political prisoners.
  -  8. Total prohibition of alcohol.
  -  9. Reforms in CID (Criminal Investigation Department)
  -  10. Change in Arms Act, allowing popular control of issue of licenses and right of Indians to carry arms
  -  11. Accept Postal Reservation Bill

Many national leaders looked at the Eleven Points as a climb down from the demand of purna swaraj. Jawaharlal Nehru in his Autobiography questioned whether Gandhi's purna swaraj was different from theirs? If not then what was the point for these eleven points when they were already talking in terms of complete independence? Further, Government's response was out rightly negative and Lord Irwin made no assurance for acceptance of Gandhi's Eleven Points. Gandhi wrote, "On bended knees I asked for bread and received a stone instead. The English nation responds only to force and I am not surprised by the viceregal reply."

## CIVIL DISOBEDIENCE MOVEMENT (1930 TO 1931)

:::details
- Dandi March (12th March to 6th April 1930) Seeing the uncompromising attitude of the government, Gandhi now decided to start the movement. On 12th March 1930, Gandhi started his historic 'Dandi March' from Sabarmati Ashram to Dandi Beach (nearly 375 km or 240 miles), accompanied with 78 followers. On 6th April 1930, Gandhi reached Dandi, picked up a handful of salt and broke the salt law as a symbol of defiance to British laws. Gandhi declared, "The British rule in India has brought about moral, material, cultural and spiritual ruination of this great country. I regard this salt March (1930) rule as a curse. I am out to destroy this system of government. Sedition has become my religion." Subhas Bose had compared the Salt March to Napoleon's March to Paris.

:::

:::details Programme of the Movement
- This included the following in addition to the pledge of  non-violence and truth.
  - Disobedience of Salt law wherever possible
  - Refusal to pay taxes to the government
  - Boycott of law courts, colleges and government service
  - Picketing of shops selling liquor and foreign cloth

:::

:::details Why Gandhi Chose Salt to Register a Protest?
- 'Ihe choice of salt initially puzzled many people. Later it appeared that Gandhi succeeded in spinning a fine strategy around the issue of salt. Salt tax was a universal grievance and affected all people of all classes, rich and poor. It was most ubiquitous of all taxes for the poor and carried with it implications of loyalty and mutual trust. In this sense, it had a far reaching emotional appeal. Salt' manufacturing could also afford a paltry yet psychologically important income for the poor through self- help, much like khadi. Like khadi again, it offered to the urban adherents the opportunity of a symbolic identification with mass suffering. Further, breaking of the salt law represented humble beginning of civil disobedience and its countrywide violation made an impressive demonstration of the power of non-violent struggle. Later, manufacture of salt became a part of Gandhi's constructive program as manufacture of khadi.

:::details  Salt Satyagraha
- While Gandhiji was marching to Dandi, the Congress leaders worked out the logistics of the salt satyagraha. They enrolled volunteers, formed grass root Congress Committees, collected funds and toured villages and towns to gain support. Once Gandhiji gave the indication from Dandi, the salt laws were broken all over the country:
  - In Tamil Nadu:C Rajagopalachari led a salt march from Trichinopoly to Vedaranniyam on the Tanjore coast and was arrested on 30th April.
  -  In Malabar:K. Kelappan, the leader of Vaikom Satyagraha, (extreme right) during salt walked from Calicut to Payannur to break the salt law.
  -   In the North-East: A group of satyagrahis walked from Sylhet in Assam to Noakhali in Bengal to make salt and break the law.
  -   In Andhra: Several bands of satyagrahis marched from villages to coast to break the salt law. A number of sibirums (military style camps) were established to function as head offices of salt satygraha.
 :::

:::details  Government Repression and Popular Upsurge
- "Ihroughout 1930, the government's attitude remained ambivalent. The government found itself in a classic dilemma of 'damned if you do, damned if you don't'; a dilemma the Gandhian strategy of non-violent civil disobedience was designed to create. "If we do too much, the Congress will cry 'repression', if we do too little, the Congress will cry 'victory"'â€”this was how the government dilemma was expressed. Either way it ensured erosion of British hegemony. However, seeing the rapid spread of the movement, the government was left with little choice and it soon took to brutal repression. As reported by the American journalist Webb Miller- "unresisting men were methodically bashed into bloody pulp". The torture inflicted upon unresisting satyagrahis resulted in arousal of sympathy and respect which rapidly converted into participation.
:::

:::details Arrest of Jawaharlal Nehru
- On 14th April 1930, Jawaharlal Nehru was arrested for breaking the salt law and his arrest was met with massive demonstrations and clashed with the police. The government tightened its repressive machinery and arrested most of the other Congress leaders as well. This resulted in the weakening of Gandhian confines of civil disobedience and there were several outbursts of violent forms. Some major outbursts were: Chittagong Armory Raid: On 18th April 1930, the Bengal revolutionaries carried out the Chittagong armoury raid. In fact, in Bengal, the whole history of civil disobedience was accompanied by revolutionary terrorism with 56 incidents in 1930. The Chittagong leader Surya Sen managed to remain underground with the help of villagers, mostly Muslims. Peshawar Upsurge: On 23rd April 1930, Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan was arrested provoking a massive upsurge. Khan had been active in NWFP for several years and had set up a band of non- violent revolutionaries, the Khudai Khidmatgars (Servants of God) or the Red Shirts (because of the colour of their shirts) who played an active role in the CDM. 'Ihe Peshawar upsurge is memorable as it was here that a platoon of Gharwal Rifles (Hindu soldiers facing a Muslim crowd) refused to open fire and became a symbol of communal unity and patriotism. This incident was proof that nationalism had begun to enter the Indian army, the chief instrument of British rule in India.
:::

:::details Arrest of Gandhi
- However, on 4th May 1930, the Viceroy finally ordered the arrest of Gandhi (he was sent to Yerawada Jail). His arrest unleashed a massive wave of protest. In Bombay, swarms of people just spilled onto the street forcing the police to withdraw.
:::

:::details Sholapur Upsurge
- The most massive demonstration took place on 7th May 1930 in the industrial city of Sholapur (Maharashtra). The textile workers who dominated the town went on strike, burnt liquor shops and attacked all symbols of government authority.

:::

:::details Dharsana Satyagraha
- On 21st May 1930, Sarojini Naidu (first Indian woman to become President of the INC), Imam Saheb (Gandhiji's co-worker from South African struggle) and Gandhiji's son Manilal led a band of 2000 satyagrahis to defy salt laws at the Dharsana Salt Works in Gujarat. Police had already cordoned off the area. As the satyagrahis moved forward, the police attacked them with their steel tipped lathis. The injured were taken away by their comrades as another column of satyagrahis took their place, to be beaten to pulp and carried away.
:::

By June end, The Congress Working Committee was declared illegal and Motilal Nehru, who was functioning as the Congress President, was also arrested.


:::details Forms of Protest
Though salt satyagraha and its more potent form-non-violent heroism (Dharsana satyagraha) stole the show as main form of protest, other forms of protest quickly emerged. Various other socially non-divisive issues were also taken up. These included the following:
- **Boycott of Foreign Cloth and Liquor**
  - A prominent role was played by women, students and youth in the boycott of foreign cloth and liquor. Bombay was particularly affected. Congress sentries were placed in business districts and ensured that the boycott was not flouted by merchants and dealers. Those who flouted were brought in line by social boycott, fines by their own associations and Congress black-listing.
- **Non-payment of Land Revenue in Ryotwari Areas**
  -  For instance, in Gujarat in districts of Kheda, Surat and Broach, people took to no-tax movement and the tax refused here was the land revenue.
-  **Anti-chowkidari Tax Movement in Zamindari Areas**
   -   The chowkidars were guards who supplemented the police in rural areas. They were paid out of tax levied on villages and were much hated as they often acted as spies for the government and retainers for the landlords. The anti-chowkidari tax agitation first began in land locked Bihar where salt satyagraha did not have much scope. Monghyr, Saran and Bhagalpur districts were particularly affected. It also called for resignation of chowkidars. Rajendra Prasad and Abdul Bari from Patna emerged as main leaders. In Bengal too, when salt making became difficult with the onset of monsoon, form of protest shifted to anti-chowkidara and anti-Union Board agitation.
-   **Forest Satyagraha**
    - In Maharashtra, Karnataka and Central Provinces, people took to forest satyagraha i.e. peaceful violation of forest laws restricting tribal and peasant rights to free fodder, timber and other forest produce. Other areas with large tribal population were also affected.
 -   **Anti-Cunningham Circular Agitation**
    -   In Assam, a powerful agitation by students against the infamous 'Cunningham Circular' was launched which prohibited students from participating in political activities associated with the national movement.
- No-revenue No-rent Campaign
  - In UP, a no-revenue, no-rent campaign was started and Agra and Rae Bareilly emerged as important centres. Ihe no-revenue agitation was carried out by the zamindars and involved non- payment of land revenue to the government. The no-rent agitation was carried out by the tenants and involved non-payment of rent to the zamindars.
-  Defending the Honour of the National Flag
   -   All over the country, people defended the honour of the national flag even in the face of severe brutalities. They had taken to heart Jawaharlal's message when he unfurled the national flag at Lahore, "Now that this flag is unfurled, it must not be lowered as long as a single Indian, man, women or child lives in India."

Other Forms of Protest - Various other forms of protest also emerged during this agitation. These included:
  - Prabhat Pheris in which men, women and children went around at dawn singing nationalist songs.
  - Patrikas, or illegal news-sheets, were circulated all over the country to defy the hated Press Act.
  - Magic lanterns were used to carry the nationalist message to the villages.
  -  Vanar senas or monkey armies of children were organised (At one instance, even the girls wanted their own manjari sena or cat army!).


The government struck back through large-scale confiscations of property, yet thousands of peasants stood their ground and the rumour spread that British Raj was coming to an end.
