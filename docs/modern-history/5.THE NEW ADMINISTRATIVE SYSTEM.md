# Administrative System Before 1857
## Land Revenue Policy

The Permanent Settlement by declaring Zamindars as owners of land brought into existence a wealthy and privileged class of zamindars which owed its existence to British rule.

### **Permanent Settlement/(Zamindaries System)**

:::details Main Conditions
In 1793 Permanent Settlement for Bengal, Bihar and Orissa
was introduced. Its special features were:

- a) The Zamindars became the owners of the entire land in their zamindaries and became agents of the government in collecting land revenue.
- b) A Zarnindar was to pay over nine-tenth of what he received from the feasting to the state, retaining a tenth as remuneration for his exertion.
- c) The land revenue to be collected from Zamindar was permanently fixed by declaring Zamindars as the owners of land.
  :::

:::details Vested Interests of Zamindar

- The Permanent Settlement by declaring Zamindars as owners of land brought into existence a wealthy and privileged class of zamindars which owed its existence to British rule.
- This class would therefore be compelled by its own basic interests to support it.
- With the Permanent Settlement the company lost all contact with the peasants whc were now at the mercy of the zamindars. - The fixation of revenue had no scientific basis and was adhoc.
- The long standing ties between peasant and zamindars were arbitrarily annulled. The burden of land revenue was very high.
  :::

:::details Problem of Permanent Settlement

- The Zamindars also faced problems. Their zamindaries were auctioned for non- payment of revenue.
- This encouraged a new group of people to become Zamindars. The urban based merchants, speculators, money lenders etc. bought zamindaries.
- This group had no permanent interests in the development of land or the welfare of peasantry.
- As a result a number of peasant uprisings took place in this region.

  ### **Ryotwari Settlement**

:::details Main Conditions

- Ryotwari settlement was introduced in parts of
  Madras and Bombay presidencies.
- The cultivator was to be recognised as the owner of his plot of land subject to the payment of land revenue.
- Here the British also recognised the mirasdars (i.e. members of village communities) and peasants who paid tax direct to state.
- These mirasdars became small landlords.
- The ryots right of ownership was however negated by three factor
  - (a) exorbitant land revenue
  - (b) Government's right to enhance land revenue at will and the fact that
  - (c) The ryot had to pay revenue even when his produce was partially or wholly destroyed.
- The pasture and wasteland which belonged to the village communities were now appropriated by the state.
  :::

### **Mahalwari Settlement**
:::details Main Conditions

- A modified form of Zamindarari System.
- Settlement was to be made with land lords or heads of families, who collectively claimed to be the landlords
  I of the village or estate.
  -Introduced in the Gangetic valley, North-West provinces and parts of Central India and in the Punjab.
- The British introduced a fundamental change in the existing land systems of the country.

## Judicial System

**First Steps by Warren Hastings**

:::details Judicial Reforms by Warren Hastings
Warren Hastings for the first time made the district as a unit of judicial administration.
In each **district civil and criminal courts** were established.
In each district collectors were to preside civil courts, and in criminal courts an Indian officer worked with the help of two maulvis.
Over the district courts were created the courts of appeal at Calcutta.
The **Sadar Diwan Adalat** (Calcutta) consisted of the Governor and two members of the council assisted by the Diwan of the exchequer.
**Sadar Nizamat Adalat** was presided over by the Nazim's deputy, a muslim officer, who was assisted by Maulvis.

:::

**Establishment of Supreme Court- Regulating Act 1773**

:::details Supreme Court at Calutta

- In 1773 the Regulating Act set up in Bengal the Supreme Court which derived its power   from the Crown.

:::

## Administrative Decentralisation

### **Local Bodies**

:::details Introduction of Local Bodies in India

- In 1864, due to financial problems the British Government decentralized the administration & promoted municipalities & district boards.
- Members were to be nominated and the local bodies presided by the District Magistrates.
  :::

### **Civil Services**
:::details Cornwallis

- Cornwallis had relegated the Indians to a subordinate position and this position did not alter in spite of the Charter Act of 1833 and Queen's proclamation of 1858.
- All the superior positions were reserved for Europeans.
- The officers for Indian Civil Service were selected through a competitive examination.
- Though the doors were open for Indians but more than one or two could never be selected because:
  - a) the examination was held far away in London
    -b) the examination was heavily based on the knowledge of Latin, Greek and English (the Indians had little background of these languages)
  - c) the maximum age was gradually reduced from 23 in 1859 to 19 years in 1878.
- All efforts of Indians to remove these hurdles bore little results.
- Apart from Civil Services all superior positions in Police, Public Works Department, Forest, Post and Telegraph and(Hea1th services were reserved for Europeans).
