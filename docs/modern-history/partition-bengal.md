### Partition of Bengal

### 1905 PARTITION OF BENGAL
- 7 Dec. 1903. Initial public planning commenced for the partition of Bengal embracing the transfer of the districts of Chittagong, Dacca and Mymenslngh and the Tlppera Hills from Bengal to Assam. The new province of East Bengal and Assam would be formed with a Muslim majority with the division being made on a religious as opposed to ethnic basis. Throughout 1904 a torrent of objection to the proposed partition was received, but It failed to move Curzon.
- 2 Feb. 1905. Government of India submitted proposals for the partition of Bengal to the Secretary of State for India.
- 9 June 1905. Broderick approved the proposals with a few minor modifications.
- 16 Oct. 1905. The terms of the partition were executed. The new province of Eastern Bengal and Assam incorporated Assam and several Bengal divisions encompassing eighteen million Muslims and twelve million Hindus. In consequence the National Congress Party now possessed an issue around which to coalesce and to stimulate party growth
- 16 Oct. 1905. Due to the immense population ofBengal Lord Curzon (1859-1925). Viceroy of India, executed its partition with the transfer of the Chittagong Division, Dacca and Mymensingh districts and Hill Tippera to Assam; Chota Nagpur moved to the Central Provinces; and the Uriya-speaking areas of Orissa transferred to West Bengal. These administrative changes offered administrative relief to Bengal and encouraged greater development of Assam.
- May-Aug. 1906. In response to the Partition of Bengal, Gopal K. Gokhale (1866-1915) went to England where he conferred with numerous members of the Liberal Party including: Herbert AsqUith (1852-1928), David Lloyd George (1863-1945). and Lord Ripon (1827- 1909). Lord Reay (1839-1921), and John Morley (1838·1923). Gokhale's program of reform called for: the election of at least half the membership of the Imperial Legislative Council, increased powers for elected members ofthe provincial councils, appointment ofthree Indians to the Council of India, eiectlon of six Indians to the House ofCommons, and greater levels of Indian influence in local government.
- Oct-Dec. 1905 in protest of the Partition, Indians boycotted British goods, produced swadeshi cloth, conducted national education, and called for swaraj. The boycott by 1908 had reduced British imports by twenty percent from 1904. In turn this stimulated local Indian industries in production of sugar, matches, giass products, shoes and metal goods.
- 14 Apr. 1906 Sir BamptYlde Fuller (1854- 1935), Lieutenant-Governor of Eastern Bengal and Assam, ordered the dispersal ofthe Bengal Provincial Conference of the Congress Party at Barisal, arrested its president, Surendra Nath Banerjea (1848-1925), and suspended more than 300 students from college for anti -partition agitation. On July 15, 1906 Fuller offered his resignation in an attempt to force the support of the Government of India for his measures. The Viceroy, Lord Minto, promptly accepted the resignation.
- 1 Oct. 1906. Lord Minto received at Simla a delegation of thirty-five Muslim leaders, led by Sir Sultan Muhammad Shah, or the Aga Khan II, (1877-1957) to listen to proposals regarding constitutional reforms for India. They included the potential expansion of Muslim representation on offiCial councils and the creation of separate Muslim representation. Later on December 30, 1906, thirty-five other Muslim delegates joined the Simla group at Dacca and formed the All-India Muslim League. Its purpose embraced the promotion ofMuslim loyalty to the Government of India, protection of Muslim political rights and interests, and prevention of Muslim communal confliCt. It also served as a useful forum for the expression of Muslim grievances to the British.

### Swadeshi Movement

:::details Swadeshi Movement

- The Swadeshi movement had its **genesis in the anti-partition movement** which started with the partition of Bengal by the Viceroy of India, Lord Curzon, 1905 and continued up to 1911.
- It was the most successful of the pre-Gandhian movements. Its chief architects were Aurobindo Ghosh, Lokmanya Bal Gangadhar Tilak, Bipin Chandra Pal and Lala Lajpat Rai, V. O. Chidambaram Pillai.
- Strong sense of unity among Bengalis fostered by their regional independence, cultural development of 19th century, spread of western education and Hindu revivalist mood gave birth to a vehement resistance.
- Though affected in 1905, the partition proposals had come onto the public domain as early as 1903. Therefore, since 1903, there was prepared the ground for the launch of the Swadeshi movement.
- The agitation against the partition had started in 1903, but became stronger and more organised after the scheme was finally announced and implemented in 1905.
  - The initial aim was to secure the annulment of partition, but it soon enlarged into a more broad-based movement, known as the Swadeshi movement, touching upon wider political and social issues,

:::

:::details Between 1903 to mid-1905

- In **first phase (1903-1905), moderate way of petitions, memoranda, speeches, public meetings and press campaigns** were held in full sway.
- The objective was to turn to public opinion in India and England against the partition proposals by preparing a foolproof case against them. The hope was that this would yield sufficient pressure to prevent this injustice from occurring.
- **Surendra Nath Banerjee, Prithwish Chandra Ray** and other leaders launched a powerful press campaign against the partition proposals through journals and newspapers like the **Bengalee**, **Hitabadi** and **Sanjibani**.
- The four leading newspapers of Calcutta- Bengalee,Amrita Bazaar Patrika, Indian Mirror and Hindu Patriot protested against this division of Bengal.
  - The **Amrita Bazaar Patrika** in its issue of 14<sup>th</sup> December, 1903 called on the people of East Bengal to hold public meetings in every town and village to prepare petition for submission to the government, which was signed by lakhs of people.
  - Vernacular newspapers such as the **Sanjibani** and the **Bangabashi** expressed open hostility against this proposal.
- Vast protest meetings were held in the town hail of Calcutta, and numerous petitions, were sent to the Government of India and the Secretary of State.
- Even, the big zamindars who had hitherto been loyal to the Raj, joined forces with the Congress leaders.
- The Government of India however remained unmoved. Despite the widespread protest, voiced against the partition proposals, the decision to partition Bengal was **announced on 19 July 1905.**
  - It was obvious to the nationalists that their moderate methods were not working and that a different kind of strategy as needed.
  - Within days of the government announcement numerous spontaneous protest meetings were held at various places. It was in these meetings that the **pledge to boycott foreign goods** was first taken.

:::

:::details 1905 onwards

- The Bengalis adopted the **boycott movement** as the last resort after they had exhausted the armoury of constitutional agitation (between 1903 and 1905) known to them, namely vocal protests, appeals, petitions and Conferences to coerce the British to concede the unanimous national demand.
- The **formal proclamation of the Swadeshi Movement was, made on the 7 August 1905**, in meeting held at the **Calcutta town hall**.
  - The movement; hitherto sporadic and spontaneous, now had a focus and a leadership that was coming together.
  - At the 7 August meeting, the **famous Boycott Resolution** was passed.
    - Even Moderate leaders like **Surendranath Banerjee** toured the country urging the boycott of Manchester cloth and Liverpool salt.
  - On September 1, the Government announced that partition was to be effected on 16 October’ 1905.
  - The value of British cloth sold in some of the mofussil districts fell by five to fifteen times between September 1904 and September 1905.
  - The day partition took effect — 16 October 1905 — was declared a **day of mourning** throughout Bengal.
    - **People fasted** and no fires were lit at the cooking hearth.
    - In Calcutta a hartal was declared. People took out processions and band after band **walked barefoot**, **bathed in the Ganges** in morning and then paraded the streets singing **Bande Mataram** which, almost spontaneously, became the theme song of the movement.
    - People **tied rakhis** on each other’s hands as a symbol of the unity of the two halves of Bengal.
    - Later in the day **Anandamohan Bose** and **Surendranath Banerjea** addressed two huge mass meetings which drew crowds of about 50,000 people. These were, perhaps, the largest mass meetings ever to be held under the nationalist banner this far.
    - Within a few hours of the meetings, a sum of Rs. 50,000 was raised for the movement.
  - The character of the movement in terms both its goals and social base had begun to expand rapidly.
- The message of Swadeshi and the boycott of foreign goods soon **spread to the rest of the country:**
  - **Lokamanya Tilak** took the movement to different parts of India, especially **Poona** and **Bombay**;
  - **Ajit Singh** and **Lala Lajpat Rai s**pread the Swadeshi message in **Punjab** and other parts of northern India.
  - **Syed Haidar Raza** led the movement in **Delhi**;
  - Rawalpindi, Kangra, Jammu, Multan and Haridwar witnessed active participation in the Swadeshi Movement;
  - **Chidambaram Pillai** took the movement to the **Madras presidency**, which was also galvanized by **Bipin Chandra Pal’s extensive lecture tour.**
- **Attitude of Congress:**
  - The Indian National Congress **Banaras Session**, 1905 (presided over by G.K. Gokhale) supported the **Swadeshi and Boycott Movement** for **Bengal**.
    - The militant nationalists led by **Tilak**, **Bipin Chandra Pal, Lajpat Rai** and **Aurobindo Ghosh** were, however, in favour of extending the movement to the rest of India and carrying it beyond the programme of just Swadeshi and boycott to a full fledged political mass struggle.
    - The aim was now Swaraj and the abrogation of partition had become the ‘pettiest and narrowest of all political objects’.
    - The Moderates, by and large, were not as yet willing to go that far.
  - In **1906**, however, the Indian National Congress at its **Calcutta Session**, presided over by **Dadabhai Naoroji**, took a major step forward.
    - Naoroji in his presidential address declared that the goal of the Indian National Congress was ‘**self-government or Swaraj** like that of the United Kingdom or the Colonies.’
    - The Congress with **Dadabhai Naoroji** as President, recognized Boycott as legitimate and accorded its most cordial support to Swadeshi Movement.
    - Another resolution asked the people to take up the question of national education for booth boys and girls.
  - The **differences between the Moderates and the Extremists**, especially regarding the **pace of the movement** and the **techniques of struggle** to be adopted, came to a head in the 1907 **Surat session** of the Congress where the party split with serious consequences for the Swadeshi Movement.
    - After the open split in Surat in 1907, Congress with under grip of the Moderates never reiterated of discussed the resolution passed in 1906. They looked up Bengal as local issue and ignored because it meant a direct confrontation with the government.
- In **Bengal**, however, after 1905, the **Extremists acquired a dominant influence over the Swadeshi Movement.**
  - Several **new forms of mobilization** and **techniques of struggle** now began to emerge at the popular level.
    - The trend of ‘**mendicancy**,’ petitioning and memorials was on the retreat.
    - The militant  nationalists put forward several fresh ideas at the theoretical, propagandistic and programmatic plane.
  - Political independence was to be achieved by **converting the movement into a mass movement** through the extension of boycott into a full-scale movement of **non-cooperation and passive resistance**.
    - The technique of ‘**extended boycott**’ was to include, apart from boycott of foreign goods, boycott of government schools and colleges courts, titles and government services and even the organization of strikes.
  - The aim was to ‘make the administration under present conditions impossible by an **organized refusal to do anything** which shall help either the British Commerce in the exploitation of the country or British officialdom in the administration of it.’

:::

:::details Form of struggle

- This was **boycott-cum-swadeshi movement.**
- In the **economic sense,** Swadeshi would represent **both a positive and a negative element.**
  - The **negative element of the economic swadeshi** was the **boycott and burning of foreign goods.**
  - The **positive element of economic swadeshi** was the **regeneration of indigenous goods.**
- **Boycott:**
  - The **boycott of foreign goods** which met with the greatest visible success at the practical and popular level.
    - Though Manchester cloth was the chief target of attack, the movement was extended to other British manufacturers also, such as **salt** and **sugar** as well as **luxury goods** in general.
    - Boycott and **public burning of foreign cloth**, **picketing** of shops selling foreign goods, all became common in remote corners of Bengal as well as in many important towns and cities throughout the country.
    - Women refused to wear foreign bangles and use foreign utensils, washermen refused to wash foreign clothes and even priests declined offerings which contained foreign sugar.
    - Fines were inflicted on anyone found using foreign sugar or salt.
    - Foreign cigarettes were bought and burnt in the streets, Brahmins refused to assist any religious ceremonies in houses where European salt and sugar were used and Marwaris were **warned of importing foreign articles.**
    - The ideas of Swadeshi and economic boycott was kept alive and brought home to every door by articles in newspapers, processions, popular songs, enrolment of volunteers to keep vigilant watch and by occasion bonfires of foreign cloth, salt and sugar.
    - All these bonfires however affected the economy of the people. To burn ‘Manchester made goods’ bought at a high price literally affects the people but swept by national enthusiasm.
  - The original **conception of Boycott** was mainly an **economic** one. It had **two distinct, but allied purposes** in view.
    - The first was to bring **pressure upon the British public** by the pecuniary loss they would suffer by the boycott of British goods, particularly the Manchester cotton goods for which Bengal provided the richest market in India.
    - Secondly, it was regarded as **essential for the revival of indigenous industry** which being at its infant stage could never grow in the face of free competition with foreign countries which had highly developed industry.
  - **Tilak** described Swadeshi as **Yoga of Bahiskar,** a religious ritual of self punishment.
- **Self-reliance or Atmasakti:**
  - The great emphasis given to **self-reliance or ‘Atmasakti**’ as a necessary part of the struggle against the Government.
  - Self reliance in various fields meant the **re-asserting of national dignity, honor and confidence**.
  - Tagore gave a call for **Rakhi Bandhan** as a token for Hindu-Muslim unity and wrote articles under title **Atma Shakti.**
  - Further, **self-help and constructive work** at the village level was envisaged as a means of bringing about the social and economic regeneration of the villages and of reaching the rural masses.
    - In actual terms this meant social reform and campaigns against evils such as caste oppression, early marriage, the dowry system, consumption of alcohol, etc.
  - Self-reliance meant an effort to set up **Swadeshi** or **indigenous enterprises**.
    - The boycott of foreign goods led to the **increase in demand of indigenous goods** especially clothes which felt short of supply.
      - The mill-owners of Bombay and Ahmadabad came to its rescue.
      - The Boycott movement in Bengal supplied a momentum and driving force to the **cotton mills** in India and the opportunity thus presented was exploited by the mill-owners.
      - It was complained at that time that the Bombay mill-owners made a huge profit at the expense of what they regarded as ‘Bengali Sentimentalism’, for buying indigenous cloth at any sacrifice and there maybe some truth in it but this is not sure.
      - Bengal had to supplement the supply from Bombay mills by the coarse production of handlooms.
      - A song which became very popular all over the country urged upon the people to give the place of honour to the coarse cloth which is the gift of the Mother, too poor to offer a better one.
    - The period saw a mushrooming of **Swadeshi textile mills, soap and match factories**; – **tanneries, banks, insurance companies, shops**, etc.
    - While many of these enterprises, whose promoters were more endowed with patriotic zeal than with business acumen were unable to survive for long, some others such as Acharya **P.C. Ray**’s **Bengal Chemicals Factory**, became successful and famous.
    - Like the Boycott, the **Swadeshi as a economic measure** for the growth of Indian Industry was not an altogether novel idea in India.
      - It was preached by several eminent personalities in the 19<sup>th</sup> century, Gopal Hari Deshmukh, better known as **Lokahitawadi** of Bombay, Swami Dayananda and Bholanath Chandra of Calcutta.
      - But the seeds sown by them did not germinate till the soil was rendered fertile by the grim resolve of a united people, exasperated beyond measure; to forge the **twin weapons of Boycott and Swadeshi** in order to undo the great wrong which was inflicted upon them by an arrogant Government.

:::

:::details National education

One of the major planks of the programme of self-reliance was Swadeshi or **national education**. - **Background:** - Students in promoting the boycott and swadeshi movement drew upon them the wrath and violence of the British Raj. - **Circulars** were issued forbidding the students under threat of severe penalty to associate themselves in any way with the Boycott movement. - Scholars or colleges whose students disobeyed the order were not only threatened with the withdrawal of Government grants and even with disaffiliation, but their students were to be declared ineligible for Government Service. - The authorities of the educational institutions were asked to keep strict watch over their pupils, and if unable to control them, were to report the names to the Education Department for taking necessary disciplinary action. - All this produced a storm of indignation in the country and the Indian-owned Press denounced the circulars in the strongest language. - **Anti-circular society** was set up with the objective of rallying students through processions, picketing, collection of funds and creating awareness. - The students of some colleges in **Rangpur** defied the Government orders and when they were fined, the guardians refused to pay the fine and stabled a national school for the boys who were expelled. - Teachers were also asked to resign for not whipping the boys. - The action of the authorities led to a movement among the students to boycott the **Calcutta University** which they described as **Golamkhana** (House of manufacturing slaves). - The earliest use of the term national education was made by **Prasanna Kumar Tagore** in connection with **Hindu College Pathshala** in 1839. The effort to organise **Tattvabodhini Pathshala** in 1840 and **Hindu Hitarthi Vidyalaya** in 1846 also indicated desire for establishing **national education**, But real credit for popularising and organising national education goes to **Satish Chandra Mukherjee** and his **Dawn Society.** - Founder-editor of the _Dawn_ magazine (1897–1913), an organ of Indian Nationalism, in 1902 **Satish Chandra Mukherjee** organised the “Dawn Society” of culture, to protest against the Report of the Indian Universities Commission, representing the inadequate university education imposed by the Government to fabricate clerks for the merchant offices. - Taking a cue from Tagore’s **Shantiniketan**, the **Bengal National College** was founded, with **Aurobindo** as the principal. Scores of national schools sprang up all over the country within a short period. - The scheme for National Council of Education was indebted to a letter from **Sir George Birdwood**, known for his valuable census of Indian crafts and industries, to Satish in 1898. **Birdwood** wrote that _while India must look to the west for scientific culture, she must never surrender her spiritual culture._ - In August 1906, the **National Council of Education** was established. - At a conference attended by a large number of eminent men of Bengal (like R N Tagore, Hirendranath Dutta, Satish Chandra Mukherjee etc.) held on 10<sup>th</sup> November, 1905, it was decided to establish at once a **National Council of Education (Jatiya Shiksha Parisad)** in order to organize a system of education-literary, scientific and technical- on national lines and under national control. The number of national schools also grew apace with time. - By the donation of **Subodh Chandra Mullick** (for which he was give title of Raja) and **zamindar Mymensingh**, in 1906, Satish took a leading part in forming the **National Council of Education.** - The Council defined its objectives in this way. . . ‘to organize a system of Education Literary; Scientific and Technical — **on National lines and under National control’** from the primary to the university level. - Under the aegis of the National Council of Education, a number of National Schools were founded at various places like **Jadavpur Engineering College**. - **Taraknath Patil** had set up the **society for the Promotion of Technical education** which founded **Bengal Technical Institute**. - But most of these schools and institutions failed to flourish due to hostile government. But Jadavpur Engineering College continued and transformed into University in 1956. - The chief medium of instruction was to be the **vernacular** to enable the widest possible reach. - For technical education, the **Bengal Technical institute** was set and funds were raise to send students to Japan for advanced learning.
:::

:::details Cultural Sphere

- It was, perhaps, in the **cultural sphere** that the impact of the Swadeshi Movement was most marked.
  - The **songs** composed at that time by **Rabindranath Tagore, Dwijendralal Ray, Mukunda Das**, **Syed Abu Mohammad** and others later became the moving spirit for nationalists of all hues.
    - Rabindranath Tagore, Rajnikant Sen, Dwijendralal Roy and Nabakrishna Chakraborty composed patriotic songs.
    - Rabindranath’s **Amar Sonar Bangla**, written at that time, was to later inspire the liberation struggle of Bangladesh and was adopted as the national anthem of the country in 1971.
    - The Swadeshi influence could be seen in Bengali folk music popular among Hindu and Muslim villagers.
  - In **art**, this was the period when **Abanindranath Tagore** broke the domination of Victorian naturalism over Indian art and sought inspiration from the rich indigenous traditions of Mughal, Rajput and Ajanta paintings.
    - **Nandalal Bose**, who left a major imprint on Indian art, was the **first recipient of a scholarship offered by the Indian Society of Oriental Art** founded in 1907.
- In **science**,  **Jagdish Chandra Bose, Prafulla Chandra Ray,** and others pioneered original research that was praised the world over.

  - **J N Tata** founded **Tata Iron ad Steel**.
  - **Prafulla Chandra Ray** set up **Bengal Chemicals Factory.**

- Later on, the economic boycott receded into background with the passage of time and it developed into an idea of **non-cooperation** with the British in every field and the object aimed at a political regeneration of the country with the distant goal of absolute freedom looming large before the eyes of the more advanced section.
  :::

::: details Methods of mass mobilization

- **Public meetings and processions** emerged as major **methods of mass mobilization** and simultaneously as forms of popular expression. - **Corps of volunteers** (or samitis as they were called) were **another major form of mass mobilization** widely used by the Swadeshi Movement. - The **Swadesh Bandhab Samiti** set up by **Ashwini Kumar Dutt**, a school teacher, in Barisal was the most well known volunteer organization of them all. - Through the activities of this Samiti, whose 159 branches reached out to the remotest corners of the district, Dutt was able to generate an unparalleled mass following among the predominantly Muslim Peasantry of the region. - **Works done by samitis:** - took the Swadeshi message to the villages through magic lantern lectures and Swadeshi songs, - gave physical and moral training to the members, - did social work during famines and epidemics, - organized schools, training in Swadeshi craft and - arbitration courts. - The samitis stuck their deepest roots in Barisal, they had expanded to other parts of Bengal as well. - **Creative use of traditional popular festivals and melas** as a means of reaching out to the masses. - The **Ganapati** and **Shivaji festivals**, popularized by Tilak, became a medium for Swadeshi propaganda not only in Western India but also in Bengal. - Traditional folk theatre forms such as **jatras** i.e. extensively used in disseminating the Swadeshi message. - **Ramsay Macdonald** visiting Bengal during this period wrote that _Bengal was creating India by song and worship._
  :::

:::details Social boycott

- It was an outcome of economic swadeshi movement. It was preached to go against the repressive measures of the Government. The social boycott was a very powerful weapon.
- A man selling or buying foreign goods or in any way opposing swadeshi Movement and helping Government in putting it down would be subjected to various degrees of humiliation.
  :::

:::details Repressive measures taken by the Government

- The government came down with a heavy hand. **Repression** took the form of controls and bans on public meetings, processions and the press.
  - The case of the **1906 Barisal Conference**, where the police forcibly dispersed the conference and brutally beat up a large number of the participants.
- Other than boycott and burning of foreign goods, people also resorted to ‘**peaceful picketing**’ which destined to become a normal feature in almost every type of political agitation in future.
  - All these gave the police a good opportunity to interfere.
- The volunteers were roughly handled and if they resisted the police a good opportunity to interfere.
  - The volunteers were roughly handled and if they resisted, the police beat them with lathis.
  - These ‘**Regulation Lathis**’, were freely used by the police in the first instance to drive away the picketers and to disperse crowds, whether rioters or peaceful.
- The uttering of **Bande Mataram** was an indisputable evidence of sympathy to movement and later it was made illegal to shout Bande Mataram in a public place.
- The official phrase, “**mild lathi charge**” to describe the assault of the police, was a misnomer. It was certainly not mild as the gaping wounds on the bodies loudly proclaimed.
- The  Government also issued **instructions to the educational institutions** to control their boys and prevent them from participating in the swadeshi movement.
  - Student participants were expelled from Government schools and colleges, debarred from Government service, fined and at times beaten up by the police.
- Rural markets were controlled, bans were put on processions and meetings, leaders were put into confinement without any trial and loyal Muslims were made to go against the recalcitrant Hindus.
- Between 1907 and 1908:
  - Major leaders in Bengal including Ashwini Kumar Dutt and Krishna Kumar Mitra were deported,
  - Tilak was given a sentence of six years imprisonment,
  - Ajit Singh and Lajpat Rai of Punjab were deported and
  - Chidambaram Pillai and Harisarvottam Rao from Madras and Andhra were arrested.
  - Bipin Chandra Pal and Aurobindo Ghosh retired from active politics.
- Almost with one stroke the entire movement was rendered **leaderless**.

### Rise of MILITANT NATIONALISM

Causes for the rise of extremists or militant nationalism are very much same as those responsible for the rise of nationalism in India. Leaders like – Tilak, Ashwini Kumar Dutt etc had been active to propagate militant nationalism since beginning. Leadership of Swadeshi Movement transferred from moderates to extremists like Bipin Chandra Pal, Aurobindo Ghosh, Tilak etc. It was due to many factors – I. Failure of Moderates – Politically conscious nationalists believed that exploitation by British will continue as moderates’ demands were making no effect on British policies. Moderates belived that foreign rule can be reformed, but it was not happening.  Anti-Congress attitude of Curzon convinced people that Congress will remain an ineffective organization  Congress largely gained status of Zamindars’ and upper middle class elite party. Poets like Bankim Chandra called the Congress session as ‘a three day annual show’  Indian Council Act of 1892 was a complete disappointment and it questioned the tactics of the Moderates. II. International Events –  Defeat of Russia by Japan  Defeat of Italian Army by Ethopians broke the myth of Western Supermacy  Revolutionary movement in Russia and Ireland etc inspired Indian nationalists  Boer War in South Africa also inspired Indian nationalists. III. Ill treatment of nationalist leaders – Lala Lajpat Rai and Ajit Singh were deported in 1907. KK Mitra, Ashwini Kumar Dutt were deported in 1908. Tilak was also given severe sentence of 6 years in 1908. IV. Evils of foreign rule were now clearly evident in death of around 3 crore people in famines from 1850 to 1900. V. Official Secrecy Act considerably reduced the freedom of press VI. Arrest of Natu Brothers in 1897 and their deportation even without disclosing charges against them infuriorated people. In the same year, Tilak and other newspaper editors were sentenced for long sentences for arousing public sentiments. VII. Spread of political education made people realize that British rule is not for India’s good and it also led to rejection of White Man’s burden theory. VIII. Indians were becoming educated, at the same time more un-employment was also a reality. Educated Indians became the torch-bearers of new militant nationalism. IX. New leaders on the bloc aroused the self-respect of people and people now find humiliating to subjugate to alien rule. It led to awareness among masses too which moderates have ignored b focusing only on upper middle class. Vivekananda said – ‘The only hope of India is from the masses. The upper classes are physically and morally dead’. X. Police assault on the peaceful delegates in a conference in Barisal emerged as one of the dastardly acts of government which angered people. XI. Immediate Causes  During time of Curzon Bengal Partition happened and it became one of the biggest rallying points in the history of Indian freedom struggle  There were other events which lead to rise in anger of people Municipal Act, Delhi Darbar being a few of them.  Burma war Failure of early militant nationalists –  They failed to give a definitive direction to the movement.  They also failed to reach masses  Arrest of key leadership left the national movement under militant nationalist rudderless.  The key rallying point – the Partion of Bengal was annuled and capital was shifted to Delhi – 1911. (However capital was actually shifted in 1912) -->

Princes, the increase of Indian representation on the Imperial and provincial legislative
councils, and the provision for debate of the budget within the Legislative Council. -->

The forces of reform and reaction operated on parallel tracks 

## 1907

### Surat Split

:::details Background and Factors Leading to Surat Split

- The all-India political alignments in 1906-7 could be best decribed as in a **state of confusion.**
  - The Bengal moderates cherished their connection with the Bombay group, but local politics imposed upon them a more radical course, as they wholeheartedly denounced the partition and supported boycott, swadeshi and national education. selfstudyhistory.com
  - These radical tendencies the Bombay leaders, like *Pherozshah Mehta, Dinshaw Wacha or Gokhale*,could not appreciate at all.
    - On the other hand, among the non-Bengali extremists, **Lala Lajpat Rai** was clearly in favour of restraint and wanted reconciliation between the moderates and the extremists.
    - Even **Tilak** was not all for a show-down; it was only Ajit Singh in Punjab who was staunchly against any compromise.
  - However, the real issue in all-India politics in 1906-7 was how far the radicalism generated by the swadeshi movement in Bengal was to be incorporated into the future politics of the Congress on an all-India theatre.
    - Already by the end of 1905 political unrest had been reported from many districts of the United Provinces, Punjab, Madras Presidency, Bombay Presidency and Central Provinces; widespread agrarian riots were reported from Rawalpindi and Lahore.
    - In Poona, plague and the interventionist prophylactic official measures had aroused political emotions that tended to radicalise public life— although still at an elite level—and sharpened the discord between Gokhale and Tilak.
- **Benaras Session (1905):**
  - In December **1905**, at the **Benaras session** of the Indian National Congress presided over by **Gokhale**, the Moderate-Extremist differences came to the fore.
  - The **Extremists** **wanted to extend the Boycott and Swadeshi Movement** to regions outside Bengal and also **to include all forms of associations or cooperation with colonial government** (such as government service, law courts, legislative councils, etc.) within the boycott programme and thus start a nationwide mass movement.
    - The Extremists wanted a strong resolution supporting their programme at the Benaras session.
  - The **Moderates**, on the other hand, were not in favour of **extending the movement beyond Bengal** and were totally **opposed to boycott of councils and similar associations.**
    - They advocated strictly constitutional methods to protest against the partition of Bengal.
  - As a compromise, a relatively **mild resolution** condemning the partition of Bengal and the reactionary policies of Curzon and supporting the swadeshi and boycott programme in Bengal was passed. This succeeded in averting a split for the moment.
    :::

:::details Calcutta Session (1906)

- At the Calcutta session, the Moderate enthusiasm had cooled a bit because of the popularity of the Extremists and the revolutionary terrorists and because of communal riots.
  - The Bengal extremists got in touch with the Tilak group in Maharashtra and sought to give the Congress programme a new orientation at the **Calcutta Congress of December 1906**.
  - Matters nearly came to a head at the **Calcutta Congress** over the question of its **Presidentship**.
    - Here, the Extremists wanted either **Tilak** or **Lajpat Rai** as the president, while the Moderates proposed the name of **Dadabhai Naoroji**, who was widely respected by all the nationalists.
    - Finally, **Dadabhai Naoroji** was elected as the president and as a concession to the militants, the goal of the Indian National Congress was defined as ‘**swarajya** or self-government like the United Kingdom or the colonies’.
  - In spite of the opposition of Gokhale and the machinations of Mehta, they scored a resounding **victory of extremists** with the help of the Bengal moderates.
    - Four resolutions on the **Swadeshi, Boycott, National Education, and Self-Government** demands were passed and **partition was condemned**.
    - It was here that the **Extremist Party was born with Tilak as the leader** and their main goal was to keep in tact the four Calcutta resolutions, which the Bombay moderates were determined to revise at the next session of the Congress.
    - Throughout 1907 the two sides fought over differing interpretations of the four resolutions.
  - The word **swaraj** was mentioned for the first time, but its connotation was not spelt out, which left the field open for differing interpretations by the Moderates and the Extremists.
- The **Extremists**, emboldened by the proceedings at the Calcutta session, gave a call for wide passive resistance and boycott of schools, colleges, legislative councils, municipalities, law courts, etc.
- The **Moderates**, encouraged by the news that council reforms were on the anvil, decided to tone down the Calcutta programme.
- The two sides seemed to be heading for a showdown.
  - **Extremists:**
    - They thought that the people had been aroused and the battle for freedom had begun.
    - They felt the time had come for the big push to drive the British out and considered the Moderates to be a drag on the movement.
    - Most of them, led by **Aurobindo Ghose**, felt that the time had come to part company with the Moderates,  push them out of the leadership of the Congress, and split the organization if the Moderates could not be deposed.
  - **Moderates:**
    - They thought that it would be dangerous at that stage to associate with the Extremists whose anti-imperialist agitation, it was felt, would be ruthlessly suppressed by the mighty colonial rule.
    - The Moderates saw in the council reforms an opportunity to realise their dream of Indian participation in the administration.
    - Any hasty action by the Congress, the Moderates felt, under Extremist pressure was bound to annoy the Liberals in power in England then.
    - Most of the Moderates, led by **Pherozeshah Mehta** were no less willing to Part Company with the Extremists.
- Both sides had it wrong:
  - The Moderates did not realise that the council reforms were meant by the Government more to isolate the Extremists than to reward the Moderates.
  - The Extremists did not see that the Moderates were their natural outer defence line (in terms of civil liberties and so on) and that they did not possess the required strength to face the colonial state’s juggernaut.
  - Both sides did not realise that in a vast country like India ruled by a powerful imperialist country, only a broad-based nationalist movement could succeed.
  - It wasn’t as though the whole leadership was blind to the danger. The main public leaders of the two wings, **Tilak** (of the Extremists) and **Gokhale** (of the Moderates) were mature politicians who had a clear grasp of the dangers of disunity in the nationalist ranks. But both could not stop the split.
    :::

:::details Split of Congress in Surat Session, December 1907
**Split of Congress in Surat Session, December 1907:**

- The Extremists wanted the **1907 session** to be held in Poona (stronghold of Extremists) with Tilak or Lajpat Rai as the president and reiteration of the **swaraj, swadeshi, boycott and national education resolutions.**
- The Moderates, led by **Gokhale** and **Firuz Shah Mehta,** wanted the session at **Surat** in order to exclude Tilak from the presidency, since a leader from the host province could not be session president (Surat being in Tilak’s home province of Bombay).
- **Lala Lajpat Rai**, who had been deported, had by then returned from Mandalay ‘and the extremists proposed his name as the next Congress president, while the moderate candidate was **Rash Behari Ghosh**.
  - But Rai, who did not want a split, refused to accept the nomination and so the ultimate fight between the two contending groups boiled down to the **question of either retention or rejection of the four Calcutta resolutions.**
- The Extremists were excited by the rumours that the Moderates wanted to **scuttle the four Calcutta resolutions.**
  - The Extremists wanted a guarantee that the four resolutions would be passed.
  - To force the Moderates to do so they decided to object to the duly elected President for the year, Rash Behari Ghose.
- The Moderates were deeply hurt by the ridicule and venom poured on them in mass meetings held at Surat on the previous three days.
- The delegates, thus, met in an atmosphere surcharged with excitement and anger. In no time, the delegates were shouting, coming to blows and **hurling chairs at each other**.
  - Some unknown person hurled a shoe at the dais which hit Pherozeshah Mehta and Surendranath Banerjea.
- Both sides adopted rigid positions, leaving no room for compromise. The split became inevitable after clash during the session.
- **Tilak** had seen the coming danger and made last minute efforts to avoid it. But he was helpless before his followers.
  - He viewed the split as a ‘catastrophe.’ He now tried to undo the damage.
  - He sent a virtual letter of regret to his opponents, accepted Rash Behari Ghose as the President of the Congress and offered his cooperation in working for Congress unity. But **Pherozeshah Mehta** and his colleagues would not relent asMehta sought to reconstitute the party by purging the extremist elements, a task which he accomplished at the following Allahabad Convention.
- The moderate leaders having captured the machinery of the Congress excluded the militant elements from it. **Minto** wrote to **Morley:** _Congress collapse at Surat was a great triumph for us._
  :::

:::details Aftermath and Effect of Split

- After Surat Split, Congress was now dominated by the Moderates who lost no time in reiterating Congress commitment to the goal of self- government within the British Empire and to constitutional methods only to achieve this goal.
  - Next session of Congress in **Banaras** and **Allahabad** were called **Mehta Congress** due to hegemony of Firozshah Mehta and was attended only by the moderates, who reiterated their loyalty to the Raj. The Bengal model of politics was finally rejected.
- The Extremists founded the **Liberal Party** and called themselves **Neo-Nationalist.**
- The Government launched a massive attack on the Extremists.
  - Between 1907 and 1911, five new laws were enforced to check anti-government activity.
    - Seditious Meetings Act, 1907;
    - Indian Newspapers (Incitement to Offences) Act, 1908;
    - Criminal Law Amendment Act, 1908; and
    - the Indian Press Act, 1910.
  - Extremist newspapers were suppressed.
  - **Tilak**, the main Extremist leader, was sent to Mandalay (Burma) jail for six years on charge of disturbing public order. **Aurobindo** and **B.C. Pal** retired from active politics. **Lajpat Rai** left for abroad.
    - **Aurobindo Ghose**, their ideologue, was involved in a revolutionary Conspiracy case and immediately after being judged innocent gave up politics and escaped to Pondicherry to take up religion.
    - **B.C. Pal** temporarily retired from politics.
    - **Lajpat Rai,** who had been a helpless onlooker at Surat, left for Britain in 1908 to come back in 1909 and then to go off to the United States for an extended stay.
- The Extremists were not able to organise an effective alternative party to sustain the movement.
- The Moderates also suffered:
  - They gave up all the radical measures adopted at the Benaras and Calcutta sessions of the Congress,
  - spurned all overtures for unity from the Extremists and excluded them from the party.
  - They thought they were going to rebuild, to quote Pherozeshah Mehta, a ‘resuscitated, renovated, reincarnated Congress.’
  - But the spirit had gone out of the Congress and all efforts to restore it failed.
  - The Moderates were left with no popular base or support, especially as the youth rallied behind the Extremists.
- In the long run, the split did not prove useful to either party.
  - The Moderate leaders lost touch with the younger generation of nationalists.
  - The British Government played the game of “Divide and Rule” and tried to win over moderate nationalist opinion so that the militant nationalists could be isolated and suppressed.
- To placate the moderate nationalists, it announced constitutional concessions through the **Indian Councils Act of 1909**, which are known as the Morley-Minto Reforms of 1909.
  - In 1911, the Government also announced the cancellation of the partition of Bengal. Western and Eastern Bengals were to be reunited, while a new province consisting of Bihar and Orissa was to be created.
  - At the same time the seat of the Central Government was **shifted from Calcutta to Delhi.**
- After 1908, the national movement as a whole declined for a time. In 1914, Tilak was released and he picked up the threads of the movement in the form of **Home Rule Movement.** After release from Jail, Tilak became Moderate.
- The two factions could again come together and the Congress revitalised when Gandhi took the leadership in 1920.

## 1909

### GoI Act 1909

Morley-Minto Reforms were introduced in 1909 during the period when Lord Minto was the Governor-General of India.

:::details I. Separate Electorates

- I. Separate Electorates – The reforms envisaged a separate electorate for Muslims besides other constitutional measures. The government thereby sought to create a rift within the Congress on the one hand by winning the support of the moderates, and on the other, to win favour of Muslims against Hindus. To achieve the latter objective, the reforms introduced the system of ‘separate electorates’ under which Muslims could only vote for Muslim candidates. This was done to encourage the notion that the political, economic and cultural interests of Hindus and Muslims were separate and not common. It sowed the seeds of communalism and checked the historical process of unification of India. It also distracted Indians from focusing on economic and political problems. Indian political leaders were however dissatisfied by these reforms. Lord Minto came to be called as ‘Father of Communal Electorate’.
  :::

:::details II. Expanded Legislative Councils

- II. Expanded Legislative Councils, but still no power – Both Provincial legislative council and imperial legislative councils were expanded but still members were elected indirectly and council didn’t have any real powers like discussion of budget, though they were allowed to pass resolutions now etc.

:::details Positive Ascepts
Positive aspects were –

- I. Voting on some part of budget was allowed
