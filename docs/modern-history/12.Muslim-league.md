35 Muslims leaders met with Viceroy Minto at Simla -- + Lord Minto received at Simla a delegation of 35 Muslim leaders, led by Aga Khan II, to listen to proposals regarding constitutional reforms for India. They included the potential expansion of Muslim representation on official councils and the creation of separate Muslim representation.
Creation of Muslim League - 1906 -- + These Muslim delegates joined the Simla group at Dacca and formed the Muslim League. Its purpose embraced the promotion of Muslim loyalty to the Government, protection of Muslim political rights and interests, and prevention of Muslim communal conflict. It also served as a useful forum for the expression of Muslim grievances to the British.



:::details Muslim League
Lack of political participation of Muslim and poor representation in administrative jobs led to formation of Muslim league. It was initially founded by a group of Zamindars and well off Muslims. Syed Ahmed Khan’s rhetoric of separate Muslim interests were its key principles.

In 1906, All India Muslim League was set up under the leader-ship of Aga Khan, Nawab Salimul-lah of Dacca and Nawab Mohsin-ul-Mulk in Dacca. The League supported the partition of Bengal, opposed the Swadeshi Movement, and demanded special safegurds for its communityand a separate electorates of Muslims. This led to communal differences between Hindus and Muslims.

Initial aims of Muslim leagues were delineated as –
- To promote among Mulims loyality towards the British
- To safeguard the political and other interests of Muslims
- To prevent feeling of hostility towards other communities (i.e. it had no communal agenda when it was founded)
