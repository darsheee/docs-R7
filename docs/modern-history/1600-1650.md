# **EUROPEAN PENETRATION INTO INDIA**

- The old trade routes between East and West came under Turkish control after the Ottoman conquest of Constantinople in 1453.
- European merchants began searching for new sea routes to India and East Indies.
- Advances in shipbuilding and navigation enabled the voyages. The Renaissance spirit of adventure motivated the explorations.
- Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route via the Cape of Good Hope to India in 1498.
- The Portuguese were the first Europeans to arrive in India. They established trading stations at Calicut, Cannanore and Cochin.
- Alfonso de Albuquerque captured Goa in 1510. It became the capital of Portuguese India.
- The Portuguese captured Malacca and Ceylon. They built forts and married local women.
- The Portuguese established settlements at Daman, Salsette, Bombay, San Thome and Hugli.
- The Portuguese power declined by the 17th century. They lost most territories except Goa, Diu and Daman.
- The decline was due to inefficient administration, religious intolerance, illicit trade practices and competition from other Europeans.
- The Dutch East India Company was established in 1602. They established settlements at Masulipattinam, Pulicat, Surat, Karaikal, Nagapattinam, Chinsura and Kasimbazar.
- The Dutch overtook the Portuguese but declined by the 18th century, losing to the British.
- The English East India Company emerged in the 17th century as a colonial power, eventually defeating the Dutch.



## ENGLISH EAST INDIA COMPANY
FOUNDATION OF THE BRITISH EMPIRE

- The English East India Company was founded in 1600 to trade with the East. It was given a monopoly and permitted to export bullion. It did not initially aim to conquer or colonize.
- The Company started trading in India in 1613 after confronting the Portuguese. Emperor Jahangir gave permission to establish factories, the first in Surat.
- Sir Thomas Roe was received as an envoy by Jahangir in 1617. The Company extended trade to Bombay, Calcutta and Madras. Political expansion began in the 1700s, controlling most of India by the 1800s.
- The French East India Company was founded in 1664 under Colbert. The first factory was at Surat in 1663. Factories followed at Masulipatnam and Pondicherry.
- Pondicherry was acquired in 1673. Chandernagore was acquired in Bengal in 1690. Dupleix was Governor from 1742, starting conflict with the British.
- The First Carnatic War (1746-48) began due to the War of Austrian Succession in Europe. The British and French companies fought in India.
- The French under Dupleix took Madras but returned it under the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle. Dupleix revealed the weakness of Indian armies against European forces.
- The Second Carnatic War (1749-54) began due to succession disputes in Hyderabad and the Carnatic. Dupleix and the British supported rival claimants.
- The French were initially successful. They made Chanda Sahib Nawab of the Carnatic. But Robert Clive took Arcot for the British and defeated the French, restoring Muhammad Ali as Nawab.
- The French made Muzaffar Jang Nizam of Hyderabad but he was killed. They made Salabat Jang Nizam and posted Bussy with troops there. But Clive defeated the French in the Carnatic.
- Dupleix aimed to expand French influence through political interference. He exploited Indian military weakness but lacked support from France, quarreling with La Bourdonnais.
- The Third Carnatic War (1758-63) reflected the Seven Years' War in Europe. The British took Chandernagore and defeated Siraj ud-Daulah at Plassey, gaining Bengal.
- The French fought on but lost influence over the Nizam. The British defeated them at Wandiwash, taking their territories. The 1763 Treaty of Paris ended French hopes and marked British dominance.
- The French East India Company lacked autonomy, relying on government support. The British East India Company was independent, with private funding and less government interference.
- French decisions were political, not commercial, reducing profits. The British focused on commerce.
- French officers pursued territorial expansion over commerce, lacking funds. The British built up finances before expansion.
- British naval superiority allowed them to transport troops and supplies, unlike the French.
- The British showed more enterprise as a private company. The French lacked initiative, relying on government. Shareholders wanted fixed dividends, not involvement.
- The British had bases at Calcutta, Madras and Bombay. The French relied mainly on Pondicherry.
- The British had able leaders like Clive, Lawrence and Coote. The French lacked talent beyond Dupleix.
- Victory at Plassey gave the British resources to expand. The French lacked funds.
- The British East India Company began as a trader in 1613 but became a territorial power, ruling India. Conquest was unplanned, resulting from Anglo-French rivalry and involvement in Indian politics.
- Success in the Carnatic Wars and over the Nawab of Bengal led to control over much of India. Britain gained resources and territory step-by-step.
- Britain took more territory to defend India, controlling the Indian Ocean. India was the most valued colony.
- The "Drain of Wealth" began in 1757, with the British taking revenue, investments and exports from India without payment. Servants extorted wealth, reducing Indian rulers and merchants.
- Before 1757, Britain imported bullion to buy Indian goods. After Plassey, they used Indian revenue to buy goods, exporting them without cost. This was a "political tribute".
- The East India Company began in 1599 to trade with India, becoming a territorial power.
