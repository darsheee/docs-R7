# 2nd-World War Time Politics

## 1939

 :::details Outbreak of the 2nd World War, 1st September 1939
- **India to be at war with Nazi Germany**: Lord Linlithgow formally declared India to be at war with Germany. His unilateral declaration without reference to the Imperial Legislative Assembly raised a storm of protest. particularly from the Congress Party.
-  **All negotiations suspended**: The British declaration of war with Germany effectively terminated any further efforts to establish a Federal India. Lord Linlithgow announced that all negotiations were suspended for the duration of the war. Much of the good will lost by the princes in the failed federation attempt was made up in their strong wartime support in men and material.
- **War aims**: Following the outbreak of war. the Congress Working Committee sought from the British Government a statement expressing its war aims on the subjects of democracy and imperialism as they related to India. Lord Linlithgow responded with a statement on October 18 asserting India's eventual Dominion Status and offering Indian membership on adVisory war committees.
- **Linlithgow met with INC**:  At Delhi, Lord Linlithgow met with 52 Indian leaders to take the pulse of Indian feeling and to explain the policy of the Government of India. Furthermore. he  announced that at the end of the war the British Government would consult various Indian groups regarding constitutional advances. Additionally he sought a consultative group of Indian leaders to assist in the war effort. The Congress Party rejected his proposals and the Muslim League remained neutral.
- **Congress ministries withdrew**:  As the Congress ministries withdrew from office, the Government of India applied Section 93 of the 1935 Government of India Act permitting the Provincial Governor to assume the vacated functions in seven provinces.
- **Zetland Announcement**: Zetland, Secretary of State for India  announced in the House of Lords that the British Government required an agreement between the Hindus and Muslims prior to further constitutional advances in India. This statement effectively released the Government of India to focus on the war effort.

:::details In midst of 2nd World War
- **Revolutionary Movement Ordinance:** The Government of India prepared the *Revolutionary Movement Ordinance* for use if the Congress Party regenerated a civil disobedience movement. It was drawn up by Sir Reginald M. Maxwell, Home Member of the Viceroy's Council. Presented to L. S. Amery, Secretary of State for India, he softened many of its draconian measures.
- **Linlithgow Offer:** With the approval of the Cabinet, Lord Linlithgow offered to the Indian parties a declaration indicating the making of an Indian constitution would be subject to the fulfillment of Indian responsibilities and obligations to the British Government. Dominion Status for India remained an objective of the British Government. The offer was rejected by all Indian parties.
- **Eastern Group Conference :** With the closure of the Mediterranean to British shipping, Lord Linlithgow initiated the *Eastern Group Conference* at Delhi to organize war production. Attendees included New Zealand, Burma, Ceylon, Southern Rhodesia, Hong Kong, Malaya, Palestine and India. The conference established the Eastern Group Supply Council to coordinate supply and to plan production of war materials.

### Individual Satyagarha
####
:::details British sense of Urgency
-  **Indians Arrested:** The Government of India responded to Gandhi's satyagraha of the Individual by arresting 182 Indians under the terms of the Defence of India Act. With few courting re-arrest, the steam had obviously gone out of Gandhi's movement. Hence, under pressure from Amery all prisoners were released by December 3.
- **Roosevelt Questions:**  Churchill began to receive questions and suggestions from President Franklin D. Roosevelt regarding India's status within the British Empire and its potential of military contributions in Iraq, Iran and the Far East.
- **Viceroy Executive Council Expanded:** Lord Linlithgow expanded his Executive Council to include 8 Indians and 3 British members. The latter held the Home, Finance, and Communication Departments.
- **National Defence Council:** Viceroy announced *the creation of a National Defence Council* with a substantial Indian membership
- **Atlantic Charter:** In a parliamentary speech regarding the August 1941 Atlantic Charter, Churchill explicitly refused to envision its application to India as regards "...the right of all peoples to chose the form of government under which they will live."
-  The Government of India with the support of the British Cabinet released from prison Nehru, A. K. Azad  and other satyagrahis.
- **Indian Conciliation Group:**  As a representative of the *Indian Conciliation Group*, Agatha Harrison communicated with her friend, Dame Isobel Cripps,  the Group's desire for Cripps to return to India.
- Tel Bahadur Sapru  and 12 other Indian moderates cabled Churchill with an appeal to give India full Dominion Status immediately, to expand the Viceroy's Executive Council into an AlI -India National Government responsible to the Crown, and to restore the Provincial Governments.
- **War Cabinet Paper:** Clement Atlee *prepared a War Cabinet Paper*, _"The Indian Political Situation"_. In it he was severely critical of Linlithgow's policies and attitudes and called for a new Viceroy who could do for India what Durham did for Canada. With the loss of Singapore to the Japanese and the reconstruction of the War Cabinet, Churchill responded to Atlee and events by **establishing the India Committee of the Cabinet** with Atlee as its Chairman

:::details Declaration of Cripps Mission proposals
- The British War Cabinet accepted Cripps offer to take the Declaration to India for its discussion with Indian leaders and the Government of India.
- At Delhi Cripps released the details of the Declaration he had brought from London at a news conference.
-  Colonel Louis A. Johnson, appointed as the Personal Representative of President Roosevelt to the Government of India, arrived at New Delhi. Two days later he called on Cripps and was encouraged to join the negotiations over the role of the Defence Member in the proposed Cabinet.
-  At Churchill's instigation Lord Linlithgow began using a direct channel of communication to Churchill and Amery, Secretary of State for India, which was largely unknown to Cripps. In subsequent days the  Viceroy forwarded several communications by this channel attacking Cripps' proposals.
-  On the issue of the duties of the Defence Member, Cripps and Johnson negotiated with Nehru a formula which would list those duties transferred from the Defence Department to the Commander-in-Chiefs War Department.
-  Cripps allowed a copy of this proposal to be given to Nehru before Lord Linlithgow had a chance to review it. When this was discovered he raised a storm of protest in both New Delhi and London.
-  Harry Hopkins, Special Advisor and Assistant to President Roosevelt, denied Johnson's special relationship with President Roosevelt. Churchill cabled this information to Linlithgow effectively diminishing Cripps' power to negotiate.

####
:::details Cripps Mission Proposals
-  The Cripps Mission proposed:
   -  Its provisions called for an elected body on Indians to prepare a constitution for India following the conclusion of the war.
   - The Viceroy's Executive Council would be largely Indianized and would take on the role of a quasi-Cabinet. Each province would have the option of rejecting the constitution and thus avoid entering the Indian Union. A treaty would be sIgned between the British Government and the Indian Government to cover matters relating to the transfer of power. For the remainder of the war, the responsibility for the defense of India would fall to the Government of India.
   -  An Indian Union with dominion status, free to decide Commonwealth relations.
   -  After the war, a constituent assembly would frame a constitution. Partly elected, partly princely nominees.
   -  -  Defence remained British; the Viceroy's powers intact.
---
-  Departures from the past:
   -  Indians would solely frame the constitution, not "mainly."
   -  A concrete Constituent - Assembly plan.
   -  Option for separate provincial constitutions, partitioning India.
   -  Free India could leave the Commonwealth.
   -  Indians shared interim administration.
---
::::
:::details Failure of Cripps Mission
-   Cripps announced on All-India Radio, the failure of the negotiations and left India the next day. He blamed the Congress Party for the failure of his mission indicating their demand for independent National Government.
-  The mission failed to satisfy nationalists, being too radical for Churchill and the Viceroy but too conservative for Indians. No middle way emerged. Congress moved to Quit India, refusing war cooperation.
::::

:::details Indian National Congress objections:
- Nehru notified Cripps of the Congress Working Committee's provisional rejection of the Declaration. He expressed concerns regarding the Indian role and participation in determining defense issues within the Cabinet.
-  Dominion status, not complete independence.
-  States represented by nominees, not elected.
-  The secession right countered national unity.
-  No real power transfer or defence share; the Viceroy supreme. The demand for a   constitutional Viceroy was rejected.
-  Liberals opposed secession proposals, viewing them as threats to India's unity and security.
- Hindu Mahasabha criticized the right to secede.
- Depressed classes feared partition would leave them vulnerable to caste Hindus.
- Sikhs objected to partition as it would result in loss of Punjab.
:::

:::details Muslim League objections:
-  A single Indian Union criticized.
-  The constituent assembly and accession procedures unsatisfactory.
-  Proposals denied Muslims self-determination and Pakistan.
:::

:::details Aftermath of Cripps Mission
-  The Government of India announced an expansion of the Viceroy's Executive Council. The change embraced the division of the Defense Department into a War Department.
-   In other changes, Jogendra Singh and Dr. Bhimrao R. Ambedkar were brought on to the Council. With these additions the Council took on the aspect of being a provisional National Government.

:::details Muslim League Observes ‘Pakistan Day’
-  The Muslim League at Lahore passed the Pakistan resolution calling for the partition of India and the development of a separate Muslim state.

:::

---

:::details Rajagopalachari Formula (CR Formula or Rajaji Formula) -[1944]
-  C. Rajagopalachari evolved a formula to bring about Congress-League cooperation, accepting the basis of Pakistan.
- The formula was evolved with full approval of Gandhiji and embodied the following terms:
  - 1. The  Muslim League would endorse the demand for independence and cooperate with the Congress in forming a provisional government for the transitional period.
  - 2. At the end of the war, a plebiscite shall be held in all Muslim majority areas in the north west and the north east that would decide whether or not these areas should form a separate state.
  ---
  -  In his response, Jinnah wrote to Gandhiji asking for detailed clarification on the terms.
  -   Jinnah was of the view that since the Muslims were a separate nation, the Muslims alone should be entitled to vote for partition and not the whole population of the disputed areas.
  -   In other words, he claimed the right of self-determination for the Muslims alone, while denying it to the non- Muslims.
  -   Gandhiji refused to accept this view and the two-nation theory.
  -   Jinnah was also opposed to a common Centre concerned with Defence, Commerce and Communications.
  -   Given the radical differences, the Rajagopalachari Formula failed.

## 1945

:::details Desai- Liaquat Plan (1945)
- Another effort to end the deadlock between the Congress and the Muslim League.
- While Gandhi and the entire CWC had been put behind bars during the Quit India Movement, Bhulabhai Desai was one of the few Congress leaders who were free.
-  Desai (leader of the Congress Party in the Central Legislative Assembly) met Liaquat Ali Khan (Deputy Leader of the Muslim League) in the Assembly and handed him a draft proposal for the formation of an Interim Government at the Centre, consisting of the following:
   -  1. Equal number of persons nominated by the Congress and the Muslim League,

- Even on these lines, no settlement could be reached.
