#### Indigo revolt
:::details Indigo revolt (1859-60) 

- The Strike of Bengal Indigo Cultivators in 1860 marked the first major peasant movement in India. European planters in Bengal coerced local peasants into cultivating indigo, leading to their exploitation and suffering.
- In 1860, peasants in the districts of Pabna, Nadia, and Barasat sub-division initiated a strike and refused to cultivate indigo.
- The movement quickly spread to other regions such as Dacca, Malda, Jessore, Khulna, and Rajsahi, as news of the strike circulated among the peasants.
- In response to the strike, a commission was established, and it supported the peasants' cause, freeing them from the control of the planters.
As a result, many planters left Bengal and relocated to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.

  :::

:::details Deccan Riots

- The basis of the Deccan Riots, which erupted in 1875, lay in the **evolution of the ryotwari system** itself.
- We come across the emergence of a class of moneylenders who fleeced the peasants through high interest on loans (25% to 50%).
- The young Brahmin **leaders of the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha** and the dominant landed families which faced decline took up the cause of the peasants.

- In fact, around 1857 some zarnindars attacked the German mission at Ranchi, as it sympathised with the Mundas.
- From around 1858 we get references to Christian tribals resisting oppressive zamindars.
- In 1867 as many as 14,000 'Christians' filed a petition against the Raja of Chotanagpur and the local police, and submitted it to the colonial authorities. Some steps were taken to restore lands of some of the dispossessed Mundas.
- 1879 the Mundas claimed that Chotanagpur belonged to them.
- was a struggle which united the 'rebels' against all Europeans
  including Christian missionaries and officials as well as the dikus and the landed elements.
- It was in this context that the Mundas were led by Birsa Munda-whose initial popularity was based on his medicinal and healing powers.

#### Moplah Uprisings

:::details Molpah Uprisings

- The Moplah Rebellion or Malabar Rebellion took place in 1921 in the Malabar region of Southern India, as an armed uprising against British authority and Hindu landlords.
- The rebellion was led by Mappila/Moplah Muslims and was a culmination of a series of Mappila/Moplah revolts that occurred throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries.
- The grievances of the Mappila/Moplah Muslims were primarily related to issues such as renewal fees, high rents, and oppressive exactions by the Hindu landlords (jenmies).
- In the initial stage of the rebellion, the targets of attacks were the unpopular Hindu landlords, police stations, and symbols of governmental authority. Lenient landlords and poor Hindus were spared.
- The British responded by declaring martial law and initiating repression measures. Some Hindus, under pressure or voluntarily, assisted the British, which led to anti-Hindu sentiment among certain poor and illiterate Muslims.
- The rebellion became one of the sources of tension during the Non-Cooperation Movement and contributed to animosity between Hindus and Muslims.

#### Pabna Riots
:::details Pabna Riots
- The Pabna Riots in Bengal in 1873 were another agrarian uprising against landlords and high rents, aimed at challenging the policies of zamindars that prevented occupants from acquiring occupancy rights.

#### Deccan Riots

:::details  Deccan Riots
- Peasant Uprising in Deccan in 1875 was fueled by multiple factors, including the burden of Government revenue, declining cotton prices, and manipulation of bonds and deeds by moneylenders in the region.
- The peasants, facing severe hardships, resorted to forceful actions by entering the houses of moneylenders, setting them on fire along with their shops, and destroying loan documents.
- The government responded by sending police forces to suppress the uprising and arrested hundreds of peasants.
- However, the government struggled to take legal action against the peasants due to a lack of evidence.
- In response to the uprising and to address the grievances of the peasants, the 'Deccan Riots Commission' was appointed to investigate the causes and course of the rebellion.
- Subsequently, the 'Agriculturists' Relief Act of 1879' was enacted, which aimed to assist peasants in repaying their loans. It also ensured that peasants could not be arrested or imprisoned for non-payment of loans under any circumstances.
- To prevent the spread of similar uprisings to other regions, the British Government passed the Punjab Land Alienation Act, which helped pacify the discontent among the peasants in Punjab.
