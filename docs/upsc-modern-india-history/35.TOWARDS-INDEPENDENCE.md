:::details Quit India Movement
- Gandhi declared Individual Satyagraha in 1941, leading to the arrest of 22,182 Indians under the Defence of India Act. All prisoners were released by December 3 due to pressure from Amery.

- Churchill faced inquiries from US President Franklin D. Roosevelt regarding India's status within the British Empire and its potential military contributions in Iraq, Iran, and the Far East.

- Lord Linlithgow expanded his Executive Council to include eight Indians and three British members. He also announced the creation of a National Defence Council with substantial Indian membership.

- Churchill explicitly refused to apply the Atlantic Charter, which advocated for the right of all peoples to choose their form of government, to India.

- Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru and 12 other Indian moderates appealed to Churchill to grant India full Dominion Status immediately, expand the Viceroy's Executive Council into an All India National Government, and restore the Provincial Governments.

- Clement R. Atlee prepared a War Cabinet Paper, "The Indian Political Situation", criticizing Linlithgow's policies and attitudes and calling for a new Viceroy. The British Government responded by establishing the India Committee of the Cabinet with Atlee as its Chairman.

- Gandhi criticized the Cripps' proposals as a "post-dated cheque drawn on a crashing bank". Nehru pointed out that the existing structure and autocratic powers would remain, and a few Indians would become the Viceroy’s liveried camp followers.

- The British War Cabinet accepted Cripps' offer to take the Declaration to India for discussion with Indian leaders and the Government of India.

- Cripps arrived at New Delhi to discuss the proposed measures regarding a constitution, progress to independence, and the granting of Dominion Status. He met with the Viceroy, the Executive Council, Gandhi, Nehru, Jinnah, and many other Indian leaders.

- A. K. Azad, President of the Congress Party, sent a letter to Cripps rejecting the Declaration for the lack of Indian control of defense matters. The Hindu Mahasabha, the Sikhs, the Scheduled Castes, and the National Federation of Liberals also rejected the Cripps' proposals. The Muslim League turned down the offer as Pakistan was only conceded by implication.

- Cripps announced the failure of the negotiations and left India, blaming the Congress Party for the failure of his mission.

- The Government of India announced an expansion of the Viceroy's Executive Council. The change embraced the division of the Defense Department into a War Department under the Commander-in-Chief and a Defense Department under Sir Firoz Khan Noon.

-  Against the backdrop of World War II ending but Japan yet to surrender and the INA's deeds ending, in October 1943 Viceroy Wavell attempted resolving the stalemate since the 1939 Congress resignations.
-  Consulting in England in March 1945, Wavell broadcast the British government's proposals to resolve the deadlock on 14 June 1945—the Wavell Plan. The Secretary of State for India made a similar statement in the Commons.
-  The Wavell Plan proposed renovating the Viceroy's Executive Council with Indian leaders pending a new constitution. Except for the Viceroy and Commander-in-Chief, members would be Indian leaders with "balanced representation of the main communities, including equal proportions of Muslims and caste Hindus." It would work under the existing constitution. Scheduled Castes would be represented. A new constitution could be discussed.
-  The Viceroy's veto would not be used unnecessarily. External Affairs would transfer to an Indian member. A conference would obtain lists from leaders for the new Executive Council. Provincial ministers would resume office, aiming for coalition.
-  The Congress leaders were released to attend the Simla Conference in June 1945, ending confrontation since August 1942. The Wavell Plan was also the Breakdown Plan—leaving without agreement was dishonorable. Disagreement would mean withdrawing to the six Pakistan provinces, leaving Congress India's rest.


-  The Simla Conference discussed the Wavell Plan. Attendees included Maulana Abul Kalam Azad and Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It reached potential agreement for self-rule with separate Muslim representation and reduced majority powers in majority regions.
-  Talks stalled over selecting Muslim representatives. Jinnah said only the Muslim League could represent Muslims. Congress could not nominate Muslims. Jinnah demanded Muslim objections require a two-thirds majority. Wavell gave six Muslims in a 14-member council veto power. Muslims were 25% of the population. Congress rejected the demands. Wavell ended the conference, scuttling perhaps the last chance for a united independent India.
-  Responsibility lies partly with Wavell and Jinnah. The three parties—Congress, the Muslim League, and the Viceroy—had to decide the conference's fate. For Congress, India was one nation; for the League, Muslims were a nation. The Viceroy's decision depended on disagreement, extending British rule.
-  Wavell gave Jinnah veto power over constitutional progress, making him the sole Muslim representative. Wavell reversed Cripps Mission proposals recognizing only Congress. Wavell raised Jinnah to Gandhi's level and made the League the sole Muslim representative, gaining a separate nation.
-  Wavell should have consulted leaders about the Executive Council list. Congress may have accepted it fully or with changes. He should not have let the League veto the entire plan, blocking progress.
-  Wavell assured Congress he would not let wilfulness obstruct settlement, but his hands were stayed, as with Cripps. Failure strengthened Jinnah and the League, seen in the 1945-46 elections.
-  Maulana Azad blamed Jinnah for the breakdown. When Congress and the League reconvened under the Cabinet Mission, Congress was less sympathetic to the League despite Jinnah approving the British plan.



-  In 1939, without consulting leaders or elected representatives, Viceroy Linlithgow declared India a British belligerent in World War II.
-  The Congress Working Committee meeting at Wardha voiced opinions on supporting the British war effort. Gandhi advocated unconditional support for the Allies, distinguishing democracies and Nazis. Subhas Bose and socialists said the imperialist war was not supportable; use the situation to gain freedom via civil disobedience. Nehru distinguished democracy and fascism, said justice was with Britain, France and Poland, but they were imperialists; the war resulted from post-World War I capitalism. No participation until India was free, but no struggle while Britain struggled.
-  The CWC resolution condemned Fascist aggression but said India could not support a war for democratic freedom while denied its own; Britain should prove fighting for democracy by ending imperialism and establishing Indian democracy; declare war aims and applying democracy to India.
-  The government response was negative. Linlithgow tried using the League and princes against Congress. Britain fought for world peace. After the war, the 1935 Act would be modified per Indian desires. Consultation would be with "communities, parties and interests in India, and the Indian princes." A consultative committee could advise when required.
-  Linlithgow's statement was policy to regain lost ground from Congress by provoking confrontation, then gaining draconian powers. Before the war, the 1935 Act was amended for central emergency provincial powers. The Defence of India Ordinance restricted civil liberties. A secret Draft Revolutionary Movement Ordinance prepared preemptive strikes against Congress, using Allied troops and sympathy by painting Congress pro-Japan and pro-Germany.
-  Reactionary policies had full support from Winston Churchill and Secretary of State Zetland, calling Congress purely Hindu.
-  It was clear Britain would not loosen its hold during or after the war and would treat Congress as an enemy. Gandhi reacted to insensitivity to Indian opinion: "...there is to be no democracy for India if Britain can prevent it." Congress would safeguard minority rights not inconsistent with independence.


-  On October 23, 1939, the Congress Working Committee rejected Linlithgow's statement as imperialist, decided not to support the war, and called for Congress ministries to resign.

-  Gandhi called Linlithgow's October 1939 statement "the old policy of divide and rule...Congress asked for bread and got stone." Congress ministries resigned, pleasing Jinnah, who called December 22, 1939 "Deliverance Day."

-  In January 1940, Linlithgow said dominion status was the goal after the war.

-  After October 1939, debate began on immediate mass struggle. Gandhi and supporters were against it, citing the just Allied cause, lack of Hindu-Muslim unity, Congress disarray, and unready masses. They advocated strengthening Congress, educating masses, and negotiating until possibilities were exhausted. The March 1940 Ramgarh resolution said civil disobedience would start when Congress was ready or events precipitated crisis.

-  Leftists like Subhas Bose, the Congress Socialist Party, and Communists said the imperialist war allowed freedom through struggle against imperialism. The masses were ready; hurdles would be swept away. Bose proposed a parallel Congress for immediate struggle; the CSP and CPI disagreed. Nehru leaned toward early struggle but went along with Congress.

-  In March 1940, the Muslim League demanded geographically contiguous Muslim-majority areas in the northwest and east become independent states with autonomous, sovereign units and safeguards for Muslim minorities.

-  In England, Chamberlain was succeeded by Churchill as Prime Minister. The Conservatives assumed power and were unsympathetic to Congress claims.

:::details Linlithgow Offer
-  On August 8, 1940, early in the Battle of Britain, Viceroy Linlithgow offered:
-  An advisory war council.
-  After the war, a representative body would frame India's constitution.
-  The Viceroy's Executive Council would expand.
-  Minorities would be assured power would not transfer to a system their elements denied.
-  Dominion status was offered; Indians could frame their constitution. A National Defence Council had advisory functions.
-  Congress rejected the offer. Nehru said dominion status was "dead." Gandhi said it widened the gulf between nationalists and rulers.
-  The League welcomed the veto assurance and reiterated partition as the only solution.
-  Dissatisfied, Gandhi planned individual civil disobedience.

:::details Mountbatten Plan
- British Prime Minister Atlee announced selection of Lord Mountbatten as the new Viceroy.
- Sir Evan Jenkins, Governor of the Punjab, assumed power of the government due to the level of communal violence and the breakdown of parliamentary government.
- Lord Mountbatten assumed the duties of Viceroy of India.
- Lord Mountbatten conducted interviews with Indian leaders to search for ideas and initiate friendships.
- Lord Mountbatten established a committee to draw up a plan for the transfer of power.
- Ismay presented "Plan Balkan" to an assembly of provincial governors at Delhi.
- Ismay delivered and explained Mountbatten's "Plan Balkan" to the British Cabinet in London.
- Nehru rejected "Plan Balkan" when Lord Mountbatten informally showed him a draft of the plan.
- Lord Mountbatten, accompanied by V. P. Menon, presented his revised scheme, "Plan Partition" for the transfer of power to the British Cabinet in London. The plan proposed granting Dominion Status and gave Indian States the choice of joining either India or Pakistan. The British Cabinet accepted the plan, and Mountbatten returned to New Delhi on May 30.
- A meeting was convened by Lord Mountbatten with Indian leaders including Nehru, Patel, Kripalani, Jinnah, Liaqat Ali Khan, Abdur Rab Nishtar, and Baldev Singh. The plan proposed that Congress relinquish its demand for the transfer of power and constitution-making before partition. Pakistan was to receive a truncated nation in a final and immediate deal, and both nations were to receive Dominion Status. Indian States were to accede to either India or Pakistan as they chose. The plan was unanimously accepted by the Indian leaders, and Lord Mountbatten announced the plan for independence to the Indian nation via radio.
- Lord Mountbatten announced the date of August 15, 1947, for the transfer of power during a press conference.
- A meeting of the Defence Committee was called by Lord Mountbatten, which included Sardar Baldev Singh, Liaqat Ali Khan, Field Marshal Sir Claude Auchinleck, and others. The committee decided to plan for the communal division of the Indian Army. The Armed Forces Reconstitution Committee was formed to finalize the plan for the Army's division.
- Mountbatten established a Partition Committee and later a Partition Council, which he presided over without arbitral responsibility. The Council consisted of two members of Congress and two from the Muslim League.

- Lord Mountbatten learned of Jinnah's decision to take the title, Governor-General of Pakistan. This decision prevented Mountbatten's plan to serve as Governor-General of both Pakistan and India for joint administration of defense, division of assets, and coordination of the transfer of power.
- Lord Mountbatten addressed the Chamber of Princes outlining their future status in either India or Pakistan. His summary of the Instrument of Accession revealed that the States were to give up only defense, foreign policy, and communications.

:::details Post- Partition Popular Unrest
- The Punjab Boundary Force disbanded. This force curbed some of the slaughter and had proven a satisfactory go-between for the two nations.
- Riots broke out in Calcutta, which were brought under control through Gandhi's use of a fast and the peacekeeping efforts of troops.
- Nehru appointed Lord Mountbatten to head an Emergency Committee at Delhi. The Committee provided transport for refugee movement, made provision to harvest deserted crops in the Punjab, improved communication, collected and buried the dead, and arranged for food and hospital care. Lady Mountbatten took charge of the relief measures in many of the camps and hospitals in the Delhi region.
- Due to the severity of attacks, the movement of refugees in either direction across the border was halted until better defense arrangements could be imposed.
- Lord Mountbatten convened an emergency meeting of the Indian Defence Committee in response to news that 5,000 Mahsud and Wazir tribesmen were invading Kashmir. On October 26, Menon was sent to Srinagar to ascertain the situation.

- At Lahore, Field Marshal Auchinleck persuaded Jinnah to refrain from forwarding Pakistani troops to Kashmir.
- Lord Mountbatten and Ismay attended a conference over Kashmir with Jinnah and Liaqat Ali Khan in Lahore.

The matter was eventually passed to the United Nations as no agreement was reached.
- Field Marshal Auchinleck left his position as Supreme Commander of India and Pakistan, marking the completion of the dismantlement of the India Army.
- Patel and Menon successfully negotiated instruments of accession with a number of small states of Orissa with the Province of Orissa.

- Lord Mountbatten and Gandhi met to discuss the Government of India's unwillingness to settle the division of cash assets and debts until the Kashmir dispute was resolved. In agreement with Mountbatten, Gandhi began a fast the next day which subsequently pressured Nehru into paying Pakistan the Rs. 55 cores owed Pakistan on January 16.
- A Hindu fanatic named Godse assassinated Gandhi. Lord Mountbatten used the loss of Gandhi to encourage the important cooperation of Nehru and Patel for the sake of the new Indian nation.

- Lord Mountbatten left India, turning over the post of Governor-General to C. Rajagopalachari.

::: details Wavell Plan
-  British Government approved the merger of 435 princely states into fourteen in western India, enhancing the financial status of several revenue-poor Indian States. This is known as the Attachment Scheme.
-  Lord Wavell assumed the role of Viceroy of India at New Delhi.
-  Lord Wavell convened a conference with Provincial Governors to discuss post-war plans. Topics included consultation with Indian party leaders, governance under the existing constitution, formation of a Constituent Assembly for an independent India, and negotiation of a power transfer treaty. He proposed an executive with equal numbers of Hindus and Muslims.
-  At Simla, Lord Wavell convened a conference with key Indian political leaders. The conference broke down due to disagreement over the composition of the Executive Council.
-  British Prime Minister Clement Atlee reconstructed the India Committee of the Cabinet. The committee decided to bring Lord Wavell to London for consultations and to press for early elections to form a constitution-making body.
-  Lord Wavell called for elections of the Centre and Provincial assemblies following the end of the war with Japan. Both Congress and the Muslim League criticized Wavell's statement.
-  Attitudes towards the World War varied. Some believed India should seize the opportunity to gain freedom by opposing British war efforts. Others believed India should cooperate unconditionally with the British, hoping for leniency post-war. Some saw Fascism as a greater threat and wanted to help Britain conditionally.
-  The Congress demanded a Constituent Assembly to the constitution of free India.
-  The British Government was to make concessions or promises about the future.
