**Simon Commission**

- Known as the Simon Commission, the Indian Statutory Commission was a seven-member group of British MPs sent to India in 1928 to study constitutional reform.
- Member Clement Attlee later became British Prime Minister and oversaw India and Pakistan's independence in 1947.
- The all-white commission faced widespread protest from Indians.
- The commission was appointed two years ahead of schedule due to the failure of the Reforms of 1919.
- The commission also examined the relations between British India and the Indian States.
- The commission's lack of Indian representation led to boycotts by the Indian National Congress and a faction of the Muslim League.
- The commission's exclusion of Indians was seen as a violation of self-determination and an insult to Indian self-respect.

**Parties’ Response**

- The Congress, under M.A. Ansari, decided to boycott the commission.
- The Hindu Mahasabha Liberals and the Muslim League majority faction also supported the boycott.
- The Unionists in Punjab and the Justice Party in the south did not boycott the commission.

**Public Response**

- The commission's arrival in Bombay on February3, 1928, sparked nationwide protests.

- The Government of India Act 1935, based on the Simon Commission's recommendations, established representative government at the provincial level.
- The first provincial elections were held in 1937, with Congress Governments winning in almost all provinces.

**Impact of Appointment of Simon Commission**

- Nehruji arrested for supporting the "No-Rent Campaign" in the United Provinces.

The Executive authority of a province was vested in a Governor appointed to represent the crown in the province, similar to the Governor-General.

- Diarchy was abolished in the provinces, with all provincial subjects administered by the Council of Ministers except for certain matters like law and order.
- Ministers were chosen from the elected members of the provincial legislature and held office during the Governor’s pleasure.
- Provincial governors had special responsibilities and could act in several matters without consulting ministers.
- The Governor had the final say in deciding the capacity in which he had to act in a particular case.
- The Governor had enormous powers, including legislative powers and control over non-votable items, comprising about 40% of the budget.
- In the event of political breakdown, the governor could take over total control of the provincial government.
- The provincial part of the Act conferred a great deal of power and patronage on provincial politicians.
- All members of Provincial Legislative Assemblies were directly elected by the people.
- Seats in the legislatures were divided among various communities and groups, with separate constituencies for General, Muslim, European, Anglo Indian, Indian Christian and Sikh communities.
- The India Act 1935 proposed to set up an All Indian Federation comprising of the British Indian Provinces and Princely States.
- The proposed federal legislature was a bicameral body consisting of the Council of States (Upper House) and the Federal Assembly (Lower House).
- The Council of States was a permanent body with one third of its membership being vacated and renewed triennially.
- The Federal Assembly had a life of 5 years unless dissolved earlier by the Governor General.
- The division of Federal and Provincial laws allowed the Federal Legislature to make laws for the whole or any party of British India or for any federated State, while a Provincial Legislature made laws for the Province.
- Residuary legislative powers were vested in the Governor General to decide in his sole discretion as to under which list a particular subject fell.

- Legislature powers were limited and certain subjects were excluded from Federal and Provincial Legislatures' jurisdiction.
- Legislation affecting the British Sovereign, Royal Family, Army Act, Air Force Act, Law of Prize Courts, and amendments to the 1935 Act were excluded.
- Legislation against British commercial interests was prohibited.
- Legislation on important subjects required prior sanction from the Governor General for Federal legislature and from both the Governor General and Governor for Provincial legislature.
- Non-votable items constituted about 80% of the Federal budget.
- Rejected budget items could be placed before the Council of State by the Governor General.
- In case of disagreement between Houses, the Governor General could summon a joint sitting, veto a Bill, send it back for reconsideration, or reserve it for His Majesty’s consideration.
- Six out of eleven provinces had a bicameral system of legislature.
- The Act enlarged the legislature and extended the franchise, increasing the number of voters and allocating special seats to women.
- Provincial assemblies' membership was altered to include more elected Indian representatives who could form majorities and governments.

Federal Structure:

- The Governor General was the pivot of the constitution, providing unity and direction.
- The Governor General acted on the advice of his Ministers, in his individual judgement, and in his discretion without consulting his Ministers.
- The Governor General had special responsibilities regarding financial stability, peace, minority interests, commercial discrimination, interests of Indian State rulers, and his discretionary powers.
- The Governor General controlled non-votable items, issued instructions to the Governor, summoned joint sittings, sanctioned certain bills, and could stop discussion or withhold assent to any bill.
- Other departments were administered by the Governor-General with the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers.

Other provisions:

- A Federal Court was established with original and appellate powers to adjudicate inter-state disputes and constitutional matters.
- A Federal Railway Authority was established, free from ministerial control.
- The Reserve Bank of India was established.
- Financial control was transferred from London to New Delhi.
- The electorate was enlarged to 30 million, but high property qualifications limited enfranchisement to 10% of the Indian population.
- Separate electorates were provided for Muslims and reserved seats for Scheduled Castes in provincial and central legislatures.
- The British Parliament's supremacy remained intact.
- Burma was separated from India and Aden was transferred from the administrative control of the Government of India to the colonial offices.
- The Council of the Secretary of State for India was abolished and advisers were appointed in its place.
- Provinces were partially reorganised and two new provinces, Sindh and Orissa, were created.
- The rights and obligations of the Crown in respect of the Indian States remained unaffected.

Analysis:

- The Act conceived the government of India as the government of the Crown.
- The Act marked a point of no return in the history of constitutional development in India.
- The Act did not mention the granting of dominion status promised during the Civil Disobedience movement.
- The Act had no preamble, contrasting with the 1919 Act and indicating ambiguity about British commitment to dominion status.
- The Act did not include a "bill of rights" or "fundamental rights".
- Incorporating a set of rights in the proposed Federation of India was complicated due to the inclusion of autocratic princely states.
- The Act was detailed and filled with 'safeguards' allowing British Government intervention to maintain British responsibilities and interests.
- The Governor General and Governors could override ministers and legislatures under certain circumstances.
- The Act provided legal instruments for the British Government to regain total control at any time.
- The Federation scheme was flawed due to the attempt to combine autocratic Indian States and British Indian Provinces with some responsible government.
- The Federation formation process was ill-conceived and illogical, with voluntary accession for States and compulsory for provinces.
- Princes were given preferential treatment to induce them to join the Federation.
- Dyarchy was proposed at the Centre, with important departments like Defence and External Affairs kept as Reserved.
- India's constitutional status as a dependency did not improve, and the British Parliament retained amendment powers and responsibility for Indian administration.
- Separate representation of communal and other groups was iniquitous and unreasonable.
- British citizens and companies must be treated the same as Indian citizens and companies unless UK law denies reciprocal treatment.
- The Act aimed to attract Indian collaborators to the Raj, move the system of imperial control from London to Delhi, and protect imperial interests.
- The Act aimed to win Muslim support, ensure the Congress could never rule alone, and over-represent the Princes.
- The Act aimed to provincialize the Congress, divert Congress attention to the provinces, and weaken the authority of the central all-India leadership.
- The Act aimed to convince the Princes to join the Federation by offering them conditions for entry.
- The Princes did not join the Federation due to lack of foresight, unresolved issue of paramountcy, lack of cohesion, desire for the best deal for themselves, and fear of joining a democratized federal central government.
- The Act was the best way to hold India to the Empire, according to Viceroy Lord Linlithgow.
- The proposed Federation was rejected by all significant groups in British India due to its limited offerings and distrust of British intentions.
- The Federal portion of the Act was not accepted by any significant group in India as it placed external affairs, defence, currency and exchange under the Governor General.
- Muslim leaders feared Hindu domination and viewed the proposed federal structure as too unitary.
- The Congress was against the proposed structure of the federation due to the inclusion of princes in the federal assembly.
- Some Liberals and Congress members were willing to consider the Act.
- Birla believed the Act was the only option at the time and thought Congress was moving towards acceptance of Federation.
- The provincial part of the 1935 act was implemented with the 1937 elections, but the federal part remained unimplemented due to lack of interest.

- Lord Linlithgow was appointed as the new viceroy to implement the Act.
- Linlithgow was hardworking and determined but struggled to connect with people outside his immediate circle.
- Provincial Autonomy began in 1937 after provincial elections.
- Linlithgow tried to get the Princes to accede to launch the Federation but was unsuccessful.
- Linlithgow declared India at war with Germany in 1939 without consulting Indian representatives, leading to the resignation of the Congress provincial ministries.
- Linlithgow focused on supporting the war effort from 1939 onwards.
