## Associations and Organisations

- Some of the early organisations were 
- the Landholder's Society (1838), 
- Bengal British India Society (1843), 
- British India Association (1851)in Bengal; 
- the Bombay Association and Deccan Association (1852) in Maharashtra, 
- the Madras Native Association in Madras. 
- the main aim of these organisations was collective action against the British policies harming their interests. 
- Their methods were mostly legal actions in courts or petition against the East India Company and British parliament. 
- They wanted reforms to be included in the Company's charter of 1853. 
- But the charter of 1853 failed to satisfy their aspirations. 
- After the take over of India's administration by the British Crown in 1858, new hopes kindled among the Indian middle classes. 
- They thought that the British government  would stop the economic exploitation and work for the welfare of the country. 
- Soon they realised that the British Crown too was out to exploit India economically. - Now the political activities increased and a number of new organisations appeared.
- In England was formed London India Association which was later merged with the East Tndia Association (1866). 
- In Maharashtra was formed Poona Sarwajanik Sabha (1870) and Indian Association (1876). 
- In Bengal was formed Indian National Conference (1883) and 
- in Madras Mahajan Sabha.
 - As compared to the earlier organisations formed by middle class elements these organisations were political. 
 - Their main aim was to protest against the British policies  through petitions and resolutions. 
 - They tried to achieve mass awakening through public meetings and statements. 
 - They also exchanged views on the national issues. 
 - Actually these organisations opened the way for the formation of a strong all India  organisation, Indian National Congress in 1885. 
 
  Around the  same time the British Government passed some repressive measures like Lincoln Act, Vernacular Press Act, lowering the age for Indian Civil Services etc.
