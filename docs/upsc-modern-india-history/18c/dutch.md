:::details Dutch East India Company
- In 1602, the Dutch East India Company was formed and the Dutch Parliament gave it a charter empowering it to make	Chinsura, the Dutch Settlement (Bengal, war and peace with other states, acquire territories
and build fortresses. 
- But the main interest of the Dutch was in the Indonesian archipelago and the Spice Islands and not India. 
- They soon pushed out the Portuguese from the Malay Straits and the Indonesian Spice Islands of Java and Sumatra and even defeated English attempts there. 
- However, they discovered that Indian trade was necessary to carry out trade with South-West Asia, as there was a good demand of Indian cloth there. 
- In return, Indians demanded pepper and spices. Hence, the credit of first making ‘Indian cloth’ as an item of export goes to the Dutch.
