:::details Vasco da Gama
- Vasco da Gama (First Portuguese India Armada, 149y8): Piloted by a Gujarati named Abdul Majid, Vasco da Gama sailed from the Cape of Good Hope and continued to India, reaching Calicut (Kozhikode) in 1498. He thus discovered a new sea route from Europe to India and became the first European to reach India by sea! This opened a new chapter in the history of India’s trade relations with Europe. Vasco da Gama led two Portuguese India Armadas (or fleet of warships), the first and the fourth, sent under the patronage of King Manuel I of Portugal and was well received by the Zamorin (ruler) of Calicut, Manna Vikrama. Vasco da Gama returned with a cargo which sold for 60 times the cost of his voyage!

:::details Vasco da Gama (Fourth Portuguese India Armada, 1502)
-  In 1502, Vasco da Gama revisited India and set up the following: ■ In 1503, the 1st Portuguese factory was set up at Cochin (Kochi). ■ In 1505, the 2nd factory was set up at Cannanore (or Kannur). Soon, Calicut, Cochin, Cannanore and Quilon (Kollam) became important trading centres of the Portuguese. The Portuguese trading points or factories on land were called Feitorias—these were unfortified trading outposts which also served as bases for naval fleet called armadas. The early spice trade comprised of mainly pepper and cinnamon.

### Formation of the Portuguese State of India
- The Portuguese State of India was meant to be a governing body of the various Portuguese fortresses and colonies overseas and it was required to function under a Viceroy. In effect, the formation of this body indicated that the Portuguese would no longer be content with mere spice trade but would set out to establish a Christian Portuguese state in the East and launch a holy war against Islam there.

### Portuguese Governors

:::details Francisco De Almeida (Great Dom Francisco)
- Francisco De Almeida (1505-09): Almeida was appointed as the first Portuguese Viceroy of India for a term of three years and sent with sufficient armed ships to protect Portuguese interests. He was directed by the government to build such Portuguese fortresses that would aim to establish Portuguese control over trade of the Indian Ocean. He adopted the ‘Blue Water Policy’ aimed at establishing naval supremacy of the Portuguese in the Indian Ocean, rather than over land. He is credited with the construction of Fort Anjediva on Anjediva Island lying at the border of Muslim Bijapur and Hindu Vijayanagar states. In 1508, Portuguese fleet was attacked by joint Muslim naval force (Gujarat Sultanate and Mameluk Egyptian fleet) at Chaul and Dabul, with Almeida’s son losing his life in the battle of Chaul. Almeida, however, defeated the joint force in the Battle of Diu, thus establishing Portuguese supremacy over Indian Ocean.
