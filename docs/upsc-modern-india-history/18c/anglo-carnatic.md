# Rise of British Supremacy

## Carnatic
After the death of Aurangzeb, the Mughal Empire witnessed decline and decentralisation of power evident in the emergence of several autonomous states. The English and the French companies began to see political future in India. By the early 18th century, the English and the French companies had already settled down with a profitable trade. The two had already become rivals in Europe and North America. The stage was therefore set for Anglo-French rivalry in India which began in the 1740s and ended in an eventual victory of the English and then began the conquest of India beginning with Bengal from the Battle of Plassey in 1757. In the words of Rabindranath Tagore, ‘darkness settled on the face of the land and the weighing scales in the merchant’s hand changed into the imperial scepter’. The struggle with the French for supremacy marked the first phase of the rise of the British power. The conquest of Bengal was the second and decisive step. Thus in this chapter, you will read about the AngloFrench rivalry, taking the form of the Carnatic Wars and leading to the elimination of the French as main contenders of power in India. You will also read about the British conquest of Bengal, through the gradual transfer of power from the Nawabs to the British in Bengal during the period 1757 to 1765 with the Battle of Plassey and Buxar emerging as major landmarks. The British initially ruled through indigenous institutions but introduced constitutional changes from 1773 onwards. British power in India was integrated into Britain’s worldwide imperial system.

####
The mid-18th century saw the gradual transformation of the English East India Company from a trading company into a political power. During the period 1600 to 1744, the Company slowly expanded its trade network in India, simultaneously easing out the rivals through a strategy combining diplomacy and war. Though the rise of British supremacy in India is usually traced to 1757 with the British victory in the Battle of Plassey, the ground for the victory was laid in South India where the British might was successfully tested out against the French Company

####
When the declining Mughal authority and the weak regional powers proved incapable of safeguarding the interests of European Companies in India, they saw the necessity to empower themselves militarily. Further, they were commercial entities, seeking to maximise their profit margins, which necessitated the elimination of competition and establishment of monopoly. Nay, they not only wanted to monopolise their trade and sell dear, they also wanted to buy their commodities cheap, necessitating acquisition of some political control over the country they traded with. In this context, emergence of hostilities between the English and the French was but natural. South India emerged as the arena of Anglo-French rivalry as it had become the main centre of French activities with Pondicherry as capital. The French had also begun to wield great influence in the neighbouring states of Hyderabad and Mysore. Besides, there was not much scope in western India because of the powerful Marathas, while Eastern India was under the strict control of Alivardi Khan. It was only in Southern India that conditions became favourable, especially after the death of Nizam-ul-Mulk in 1748. Thus, for nearly 20 years from 1744 to 1763, the English and the French remained embroiled in a bitter war in south India, a series of conflicts popularly known as the Carnatic Wars (1740-63).

### First Carnatic War (1740-48)

####
:::details Austrian War of Succession (1740)
####
The immediate context for conflict between two European rivals in India was provided by the War of Austrian Succession in Europe which broke out in Europe in 1740 between Austria and Prussia. In this war, Britain and France joined opposite camps. Perhaps conscious of their relatively weaker position, the French tried hard to prevent the extension of war to India and Dupleix advised his English counterpart to maintain neutrality. But the English did not agree, instead deliberately adopted aggressive stand and seized some French ships off the south-eastern coast of India. The French had no fleet in India, hence Dupleix (the French Governor General) messaged La Bourdonnais (the French Governor of Mauritius) for reinforcements. La Bourdonnais immediately left with a squadron of 3,000 men towards the Coromandel Coast. As soon as the help arrived, the French attacked the English and captured the British possessions in Fort St George, Madras and other nearby areas (21 September 1746). Included among the prisoners of war was Robert Clive. The First Carnatic War had begun

####
Anwaruddin, the Nawab of Carnatic, disapproved of hostilities in his kingdom. Thus, when the English appealed to him for protection, the Nawab asked the French to quit Madras. But the French were now in no mood to retreat and neglected the advice just as the English had done earlier.
:::

####
:::details  Battle of St. Thomas (or St. Thome, 1746)
####
The Nawab now sent a large army to fight against the French. A large Indian army of 10,000 under Mahfuz Khan met a small French army consisting of 230 Europeans and 700 Indian soldiers under Capt. Paradise on the banks of River Adyar at Mylapore near St. Thomas in 1746. But to everyone’s surprise, a handful of properly trained soldiers of the French army routed Anwaruddin’s vast army. This amply demonstrated the superiority of the European troops and exposed the military weakness of the Indian rulers. Dupleix learnt the lesson that in any quarrel between Indian princes, his disciplined army would be very useful. And in the 18th-century political chaos, there was no dearth of Indian princes who would invite Dupleix’s assistance to turn the scales in their favour. At that time, Indian rulers were not guided by patriotism and did not hesitate in inviting foreigners in settling accounts with their rivals. In this way, it was Dupleix who first showed the way of intervening in disputes of the Indian rulers and thereby acquiring political control—a technique which was later perfected by the English Company.

:::details Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)
####
Even as the French continued the siege, the War of Austrian Succession came to an end by the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) on the basis of mutual restitution of conquests. This brought an end to the first round of Anglo-French conflict in India as well. Madras was restored to the English and the French got Louisburg in North America. The first round of conflict had ended in a draw.

### Second Carnatic War (1749-54)

Dynastic feuds in South India provided the context for the second round of Anglo-French conflict in the south. The succession disputes at both Carnatic and Hyderabad provided the French Governor General Dupleix an opportunity to intervene in Indian politics.

####
:::details Succession Disputes in Carnatic and Hyderabad
####
In 1740, the Marathas had invaded the Carnatic and killed Nawab Dost Ali and took his son-in- law Chanda Sahib as prisoner to Satara. In 1743, the Nizam of Hyderabad felt prompted to come to the Carnatic and appoint Anwaruddin Khan as the Nawab of Carnatic. But in 1748, Chanda Sahib was set free by the Marathas and the same year, Nizam of Hyderabad Nizam-ul-Mulk Asaf Jah passed away. He was succeeded by his son Nasir Jung but his grandson, Muzaffar Jung laid claim to the throne. Muzaffar Jung now allied with Chanda Sahib to gain their respective seats in Hyderabad and the Carnatic.

:::details  Intervention by Dupleix
####
In this way, Dupleix soon got his opportunity and astounding success awaited his plans. He was able to interfere in the wars of succession that started after the death of Asaf Jah (1748). He pledged French support to Muzaffar Jung and Chanda Sahib. Thus, a tripartite understanding was developed among the French, Chanda Sahib and Muzaffar Jung.

In August 1749, the three allies ambushed and killed Anwaruddin at the Battle of Ambur, near Vellore. His son Muhammad Ali fled to Trichinopoly and Chanda Sahib became Nawab of Carnatic. He rewarded the French with a grant of 80 villages near Pondicherry. Feeling the extension of French influence, the British decided to support Nasir Jung for the throne of the Nizam and Muhammad Ali for the Nawabship of the Carnatic. Thus, began the second phase of the AngloFrench War, also known as the Second Carnatic War.

####
Soon the French and their allies marched to the Deccan. The French army surprised and killed Nasir Jung and installed French protege Muzaffar Jung as the Nizam of Hyderabad. Muzaffar Jung amply rewarded Dupleix by appointing him honorary governor of all the Mughal Dominions south of the River Krishna. Territories near Pondicherry as well as the famous market town of Masulipatam in Orissa were also ceded to the French. In return, Dupleix placed at the disposal of Muzaffar Jung the services of his best officer— Marquis de Bussy, with a French army. This was also the best way of safeguarding French interests at the Hyderabad court. Dupleix was now at the height of his political power and his dream of an empire now seemed likely to be realized. Soon afterwards, Muzaffar Jung was killed in an accidental skirmish (February 1751). However, Bussy maintained French influence in the Deccan by quickly placing his nominee Salabat Jung on the throne. In this way, Bussy went on to control the political fortunes of the Deccan for seven years and even induced the Nizam to grant him four rich districts on the Coromandel Coast known as the Northern Circars (or Northern Sarkars), comprising Mustafanagar, Ellore, Rajamundry and Chicacole. The French power in south India was now at its height but not far away from its fall.

:::details Emergence of Robert Clive
####
Meanwhile, Muhammad Ali (the son of the late Nawab Anwaruddin) had taken refuge in the fortress of Trichinopoly and the repeated attempts of Chanda Sahib and the French to capture the fortress had failed. The British, realising that the situation implied a serious threat to their position in Southern India, now decided to put their entire strength behind Muhammad Ali. At this crucial juncture, there appeared a man on the scene endowed with a daring genius, whose intelligence and bravery saved the fortunes of the English. He was a young clerk of the Company, Robert Clive. He suggested that French pressure on Muhammad Ali could be released by attacking Arcot, the capital of Carnatic. Thus, attack upon Arcot was to be used as a diversionary tactic. Chanda Sahib would have to divert an effective part of his army for the protection of Arcot.

####
:::details Siege of Arcot (August 1751)
####
Clive’s plan seemed well conceived and once it was approved, Clive stormed Arcot with a small force of only 210 men and captured it (August 1751). The plan had the desired effect and Chanda Sahib, alarmed by the fall of his capital, sent a large portion of his force from Trichinopoly which comprised of 4,000 men to recapture Arcot. Clive successfully sustained the famous siege for 53 days (23 September to 14 November). In the meantime, Clive received help in the form of reinforcements from Madras and some Indian allies (rulers of Mysore, Tanjore and the Marathas). Clive then came out of the besieged town, attacked and defeated Chanda Sahib at several important battles including one fought at Kaveripak. Meanwhile, encouraged by the capture of Arcot, a strong English force led by Stringer Lawrence relieved Trichinopoly following the surrender of French forces (June 1752). Chanda Sahib was treacherously captured and beheaded by the Raja of Travancore. Mohammad Ali then became the undisputed Nawab of the Carnatic. Dupleix’s high hopes were thus dashed to the ground.

####
:::details  Recall of Dupleix, 1754
####
- The French defeat at Trichinopoly sealed the fate of Dupleix. The Directors of the French Company did not appreciate his political ambitions and disproved of the expenses they involved and recalled him. On 1 August 1754, Godeheu succeeded Dupleix as French Governor General in India. Recall of Dupleix proved to be a big blow to the fortunes of the French Company in India.



:::

####
:::details Treaty of Pondicherry, 1755
####
- In complete reversal to Dupleix’s policy, Godeheu signed a peace treaty, the Treaty of Pondicherry, with the English in 1755. As per this treaty, both the companies agreed not to interfere in the quarrels of the Indian princes. The second round of conflict had also proved inconclusive. Nevertheless, after this treaty, though the French continued to maintain their hold over Hyderabad for some time, they had lost much of their prestige and their predominant position in the Deccan had been definitely undermined. On the other hand, English influence had been established in Carnatic, with their candidate Mohammad Ali installed as the Nawab of Carnatic.

### Third Carnatic War (1757-63 AD)


####
:::details  Context of Seven Years' War, 1756
####
- Like the first Carnatic war, even this war was an echo of the hostilities in Europe. In 1756 A.D the Seven Years’ War broke out in Europe. In this War, England and France joined opposite camps which ended the short peace between the European companies in India as well.
:::

####
:::details  Arrival of Count de Lally (April 1758)
####
- This time the French Government made a determined effort to oust the English from India. For this purpose, the French sent an impressive French army headed by Count de Lally, who reached India after a long voyage of 12 months in April 1758. By this time, the English had already won the Battle of Plassey and they returned to India with fresh reinforcements of men and material.

:::

####
:::details Problems Faced by the French Army
####
- Lally started his work vigorously. He attacked Fort St. David and captured it and other small English possessions in this region. But the French victory was only short-lived as problems of varying nature began to surface on the horizon. Lally’s attack on Madras ended in failure as he could not get naval support in time. The French Company also faced shortage of ammunition as well as lack of funds to pay the troops. Lally was rude and overbearing in his conduct with the subordinates, i.e. the Company’s servants of Pondicherry. He held a very low opinion of them and looked down upon them as dishonest rogues to be set right with threats and punishment. In such circumstances, both Lally and his soldiers distrusted each other and the French troops felt badly demoralised. At this critical juncture, rash and headstrong Lally committed another great blunder of prevailing upon Bussy and recalling him from the Nizam’s court, leaving the French army under incompetent commanders. Having assessed the situation, the English sent an army from Bengal to the Northern Circars. They occupied Rajamundry and Masulipatam and also concluded a favourable treaty with Nizam Salabat Jung. French influence in Deccan was thus irrevocably lost

:::

####
:::details  Battle of Wandiwash (1760)
####
- The battle still continued and Lally was eventually defeated decisively at the Battle of Wandiwash or Vandvasi now in Tamil Nadu (22 January 1760). The English army led by General Eyre Coot totally routed the French army under Lally and Bussy was taken prisoner. Defeated, the French retreated to Pondicherry. But, the English soon laid siege to Pondicherry as well, forcing Lally to ask for help from Nawab Hyder Ali of Mysore. However, due to lack of coordination, the contingent sent by Hyder returned to Mysore without fighting even a single battle. The French capital of Pondicherry finally surrendered on 16 January 1761. The fall of Pondicherry sounded the death knell of French dominions in India. Shortly-thereafter Jinje and Mahe on the Malabar Coast also surrendered to the English, leaving the French without even a toehold in India.

:::

####
:::details  Peace of Paris, 1763
####
- The Third Carnatic War ended officially in 1763 with the conclusion of the Peace of Paris, at the end of the
Seven Years’ War. As per the treaty, Pondicherry and some other French settlements were no doubt
returned to France, but these were never to be fortified again and could only function as mere trading
centres. The worst fate awaited Lally. He was detained as a prisoner of war for two years, after which he
was allowed to return to his home country, where, far from receiving any kind treatment, he was first
imprisoned and then executed. Thus, the Third Carnatic War brought down the curtain to the Anglo-French rivalry in India and cleared the way for the establishment of the British Empire.
