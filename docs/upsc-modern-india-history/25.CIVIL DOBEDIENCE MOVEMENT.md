- The Simon Commission was established by the British government in 1927 to review the Government of India Act 1919, but it lacked Indian representation, causing outrage.
- The Commission recommended responsible government in provinces, a federal union, extended franchise, and an enlarged legislature.
- The Indian National Congress opposed the Commission due to its all-British composition, leading to protests and black flags upon its arrival in India.
- The Commission's recommendations led to the Government of India Act 1935 and influenced the Indian Constitution.
- The Simon Commission allowed young leaders like Bhagat Singh to rise to prominence and fueled socialism and new leaders like Subhas Chandra Bose.
- The Commission's report disappointed the Congress and the Muslim League as it did not mention Dominion Status or the right to secession.
- Muhammad Ali Jinnah drafted his Fourteen Points in response, demanding separate electorates, 33% Muslim seats in the central legislature, provincial autonomy, and other protections for Muslims.
- Over Dominion Status, Gandhi and Motilal Nehru argued for giving the government two years, which was later reduced to one year.
- Viceroy Lord Irwin vaguely offered Dominion Status and a Round Table Conference in 1929, leading to the Congress demanding Purna Swaraj under Jawaharlal Nehru.
- The Congress decided to boycott the Round Table Conference, demand Purna Swaraj, have legislators resign, and celebrate 26 January 1930 as Independence Day.
- Gandhi proposed 11 demands to Irwin, including abolishing the salt tax, leading to the launch of the Salt Satyagraha and Civil Disobedience Movement.
- The government violently repressed the movement, arresting around 60,000 people and declaring the Congress illegal.
- Gandhi and Irwin entered into a pact on 5 March 1931, ending the civil disobedience movement and allowing Congress to attend the Round Table Conference.
- The pact was criticized for not gaining definite concessions and compromising on Swaraj.
- The Skeen Committee recommended increasing Indian places at Sandhurst and planning an Indian Sandhurst.
- Lord Reading announced the British Doctrine of Unfettered Paramountcy, recognizing the right to intervene in Indian princes' internal affairs.
- The Simon Commission visited India, provoking violent protests and leading to the death of Lajpat Rai.
- The Simon Commission recommended provincial autonomy, a central legislature elected by provincial legislatures, and no Muslim protections.
- The Butler Committee examined financial and economic relationships between British India and Indian princes.
- Vallabhbhai Patel called a no-tax campaign in Bardoli, leading to a tax decrease.
- The government arrested 33 Indian Communist Party members in the Meerut Conspiracy Case.
- HSRA members detonated bombs and fired revolvers in the Imperial Legislative Council chamber.
- Irwin promulgated the Public Safety Bill, deporting involved Englishmen and prosecuting involved Indians.
- Irwin announced India would gain Dominion Status, but Congress rejected the declaration.
- Congress refused to attend the London Round Table Conference due to communal division and lack of British support for freedom.
- Congress demanded complete independence, not Dominion Status, and approved civil disobedience.
- The government allowed Gandhi's civil disobedience movement, emerging as the salt march to Dandi.
- Gandhi reached Dandi and violated the salt law, leading to the arrest of Jawaharlal Nehru.
- About 100 Indians attacked Chittagong police and railway armories, taking arms and ammunition.
- Abdul Ghaffar Khan's arrest in Peshawar led to violence and loss of British control for days.
- The government arrested Gandhi, jailing him at Yervada jail for unlawful activities.
- With Gandhi jailed, civil disobedience intensified with raids on salt depots, forest law disobedience, tax refusal, foreign cloth/liquor boycotts, and avoiding British firms.
- The government declared the Indian National Congress and Congress Working Committee illegal.
- Irwin allowed Tej Bahadur Sapru and Mukund Ramrao Jayakar to visit jailed Gandhi and Jawaharlal Nehru end civil disobedience and gain Congress participation in the London Round Table Conference.
