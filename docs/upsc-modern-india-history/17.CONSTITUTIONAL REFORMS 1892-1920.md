## **The Indian Council’s Act, 1892**

- The Indian Councils Act 1892 was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that authorized an increase in the size of the various legislative councils in British India.

**Background**

- The growth of the Indian Constitution after the Act of 1861 is largely the story of political disaffection and agitation alternating with Council reform.
  - The reforms grudgingly conceded were always found inadequate, occasioned disaffection and evoked demand for further reforms.
  - It is true of all subsequent Acts passed by the British Parliament relating to India, namely the Acts of 1892, 1909, 1919 and 1935.
- The Legislative Council created by the Act of 1861, naturally enough, failed to satisfy the aspirations of the people of the land.
  - The element of non officials, negligible as it was, did not even represent the people.
  - It consisted of either big zamindars, retired officials or Indian princes, none of whom could claim to understand the problems of the people.
- The initial objective of the Congress was to mobilise public opinion in India, to ventilate the grievances of the people and to press for reforms in a constitutional but nonetheless in an emphatic manner.
- Before the Act of 1892 was passed, the Indian National Congress had adopted some resolutions in its sessions in 1885 and 1889 and put its **demand**.
  - One of the demand was: _Reforms of the legislative council and adoption of the principle of election in place of nomination and and all budgets should be referred to these Councils for consideration._
  - The Indian leaders wanted **admission of a considerable number of the elected members.**
  - The Indian leaders wanted a **right to discussion on budget matters.**
  - They also wanted the **creation of similar councils of North western Province and Oudh** and also for **Punjab**
  - These demands reflected the dissatisfaction of the Indian National Congress over the existing system of governance.
- In the beginning the attitude of the British Government was friendly and sympathetic towards the Congress but by 1888 that attitude changed.
  - Lord Dufferin in that year made a frontal attack on the Congress by dubbing it as representing only ‘a microscopic minority’ and Congress demands as ‘a big jump into the unknown’.
- Though **Lord Dufferin** thus tried to belittle the importance and representative character of the Congress he was astute to realise the significance of the movement launched by the Congress and he secretly sent to England proposals for liberalising the Councils.
  - He also **appointed a Committee of his Council** to prepare a plan for the enlargement of Provincial Councils, for the enhancement of their status, the multiplication of their functions, the partial introduction in them of the elective principle and the liberalisation of their general character as political institutions.
  - At the same time he declared in plain words that it should not be concluded that he was contemplating to set up a parliamentary system after the British model. He repudiated strongly any such intention on his part.
  - The **report of the Committee together with Lord Dufferin’s own views** was sent to the authorities in England **proposing changes in the composition and functions of the Councils** with the main aim to give a still wider share in the administration of public affairs to such Indian gentlemen as their influence is fitted to assist with their counsel the responsible rulers of the country.
- The Conservative Ministry in England at the instance of Lord Cross, Secretary of state for India, introduced in 1890 a bill in the House of Lords on the basis of these proposals but the measure proceeded at a slow speed and was passed only two years later as the **Indian Councils Act.**

**Provisions of the Act**

- The Act dealt exclusively with the **powers, functions and composition of the Legislative Councils in India.**
- **The Central Legislature:**
  - The Act **increased the number of the additional (non-official) members** in councils to **between 10 and 16.**
    - The Council now had:
      - 6 officials,
      - 5 nominated non-officials,
      - 4 nominated by the provincial legislative councils of Bengal Presidency, Bombay Presidency, Madras Presidency and North-Western Provinces and
      - 1 nominated by the chamber of commerce in Calcutta.
      - The **law member was made a permanent member.**
      - In 1892, the council consisted of 24 members, only five being where Indians.
    - The increase was described as ‘a very paltry and miserable addition’. But Curzon defended it on the ground “that the efficiency of a deliberative body is not necessarily commensurate with its numerical strength”.
    - Subject to the approval of the Secretary of State in Council, the **Governor General was to make regulations under which the nomination of the additional members** was to be made.
  - The Act also provided that **two-fifths of the total members of the Council** were to be **non officials.** These non officials were **partly nominated** and **partly elected.**
    - The **principle of election was conceded to a limited extent.** An element of election was sought to be introduced for the first time.
  - The **rights of the members of the Legislatures were increased**.
    - They were entitled to **express their views upon Budget** which were henceforth to be made on the floor of the Legislatures.
      - But they were not empowered to move resolutions or divide the House in respect of any financial question.
    - They were **empowered to put questions** within certain limits to the Government on **matters of public interest** after **giving a six days’ notice.**
    - But **no right to ask supplementary questions.**
- **The provincial legislature:**
  - The Act **enlarged the number of ‘additional’ members:**
    - In case of **Bombay** and **Madras** 8-20,
    - in case of the **Bengal** 20,
    - in case of **North Western province** and **Oudh** 15.
  - Hence the Councils in Bombay, Madras and Bengal had a maximum of twenty additional members.
    - Of these, nine were officials, four nominated non officials and seven elected.
    - The electing bodies in the provinces were District Broads and Municipalities, Universities and Chambers of Commerce.
  - In their functions the members of the Provincial Legislatures secured the right of interpellation of the executive in the **matters of general public interest.**
  - They could also **discuss the policy of the Government and ask questions,** which required a six days’ previous notice. And their questions too (like centre) could be disallowed without assigning any reason.
- **The Principle of Election under the Act:**
  - The significant feature of the Act was the principle of election which it introduced, though the **word ‘election’ was very carefully avoided in it.**
  - **Central Legislature:**
    - In addition to the officials, the Central Legislature was to have elected **non officials** whose number was to be **five** and who were to be elected:
      - one each by the non-official members of the four Provincial Legislatures of Madras, Bombay, Bengal and the North Western Provinces and
      - one by the Calcutta Chamber of Commerce.
    - The **other five non officials were nominated** by the Governor General.
  - **Provincial Legislature:**
    - In the case of the Provincial Legislatures, the bodies permitted to elect members were:
      - Municipalities,
      - District Boards,
      - Universities and
      - the Chambers of Commerce.
  - The ‘elected’ members were officially declared as ‘nominated’ though after taking into consideration the recommendation of the bodies described above (to avoid the word ‘election’).

**Significance**

- The Indian Councils Act of 1892 was an advance on the Act of 1861.
- The act of 1892 can be said to be a **First step towards the beginning of the parliamentary system in India.**
- The **principle of election**, veiled though it was in the Act of 1892, was a measure of considerable constitutional significance.
- The Act of 1892 **widened the functions of the legislatures.**
  - The members could ask questions and thus obtain information which they desired from the executive.
  - The financial accounts of the current year and the budget for the following year were presented to the legislatures, and the members were permitted to make general observations on the budget and make suggestions for increasing or decreasing revenue or expenditure.
  - At least, they were enabled to indulge in a criticism of the Financial Policy of the Government.
- As the functions of the legislatures were widened they **attracted the country’s best talent.**
  - Eminent Indian leaders like Gopal Krishna Gokhale, Ashutosh Mookerjee, Rash Behari Ghosh and Surendra Nath Banerjee found their way in the Legislatures.
  - Their eloquence and political wisdom amply demonstrated the parliamentary capacity and patriotism of the educated Indians.
- The size of the Legislatures both at the Centre and in the Provinces was **enlarged**.
  - In case of the Centre the maximum and minimum of additional members and the element of non officials therein were raised by four in each case as compared to the Act of 1861.
- **Criticism:**
  - The Act failed to satisfy Indian nationalists and was criticised at successive sessions of the Indian National Congress.
  - The goal of the representative government was yet a far cry.
  - The system of election in the Act was a roundabout one.
    - The so-called right of election to the Legislatures enjoyed by the local bodies and by other electorates amounted merely to nomination by these bodies, but it was up to the government to accept them or reject them.
  - The rules of election were unsatisfactory. **Certain classes were over represented** while others did not get any representation at all.
    - In the case of Bombay, out of six seats two were given to European merchants but none to the Indian mercantile community.
    - Two seats were assigned to Sind but none to Poona and Satara.
  - The **functions** of the Legislative Councils were **strictly limited.**
    - The members could not ask supplementary questions.
    - Any question could be disallowed and there was no remedy against it.
    - The Councils did not get any substantial control over the budget.
    - In his Presidential address delivered in 1893 at the Lahore session of the Congress, Dadabhai Naoroji observed:
      - “_By the Act of 1892 no member shall have the power to submit or propose any resolution or divide the Council in respect of any such financial discussion or in answer to any question asked under the authority of this Act or the rules made under this Act. Such is the poor character of the extent of the concession made to discuss finances or to put questions. Rules made under this Act shall not be subject to alterations or amendment at meetings for the purpose of making laws and regulations. Thus , we are to all intent and purposes under an arbitrary rule_.”
  - The Act was policy of the British for gradually involving Indians in the British administrative structure with the object of preventing any major upsurge from the nationalist front by creating a permanent group of loyalists.
  - Contrary to the Congress faith in the policy of petition, prayer and protest, the Indian Councils Act did not satisfy the public demand. The congress way of demand was seen as a weakness by the British Government. This was evident from the **following note by BG Tilak:**_“……political rights will have to be fought for. The moderates think that these can be won by persuasion. We Think that they can only be obtained by strong Pressure…”_
- Though the Act of 1892 fell far short of the demands made by the Congress it was undoubtedly a great advance on the existing state of things. By conceding the principle of election of representatives and giving the Legislature some control over the Executive, the Act did pave the way for the introduction of parliamentary responsible government in India.

## **Morley-Minto Reforms, 1909 or Indian Councils Act, 1909**

- The **Indian Councils Act 1909**, commonly known as the Morley-Minto Reforms, was an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that brought about a limited increase in the involvement of Indians in the governance of British India.
  - The Act amended the Indian Councils Acts of 1861 and 1892
  - The Morley-Minto Reforms, so named after **Morley**, the secretary of state, and **Minto**, the viceroy at that time, were preceded by two important events.

**Background:**

- **Discontent among Indians because:**
  - The Indian Councils Act of 1892 failed to meet the legitimate wishes of the Congress.
  - **Lord Curzon’s imperialist policies** and attitudes intensified bitterness of the intelligentsia against alien domination. selfstudyhistory.com
    - Curzon had no sympathy for the aspirations of Indians.
    - He completely officialised the Calcutta Corporation, giving it a European majority by reducing total membership by a third, through his infamous Act of 1899.
    - A similar policy was pursued towards the Indian Universities in 1904, which took away the autonomy of these Universities, and in the same year (1904) the Official Secrets Act greatly extended the scope of the term “sedition”.
  - The continuing **economic exploitation by the British rulers** led to the energetic thesis by patriots like R.C. Dutt, Dadabhai Naoroji and others contending that the impoverishment of the country was the direct result of a deliberate and systematic policy of the foreign rulers.
  - Educated Indians were not given any share, much less their due share in the Government services and the administration.
  - **Indian overseas** and specially in South Africa were being subjected to humiliation and indignities galore simply because they were Indians.
    - This fanned national resentment and the people of India began to feel that it was vain and futile to hope for improvement in the conditions and treatment of Indians in the British colonies and overseas possessions unless and until they were free in their own homeland.
  - The closing years of the nineteenth century witnessed the horrors of **famine and bubonic plague**, bringing distress and misery to thousands of people. The people blamed the British Government for their plight.
  - The climax was reached by the **infamous Partition of Bengal in 1905** which was considered to be “a subtle attack on the growing solidarity of Bengali nationalism.” The Bengalis felt “humiliated, insulted and tricked” and resorted to a vigorous agitation to get the wrong undone.
  - The press in the country which was free since 1882 took ample notice of all these factors and was extremely critical of the British administration.
- While the Congress was growing stronger as the exponent of the demand for national freedom, the Muslims generally kept themselves aloof from it.
  - Their ‘indifference’, at its initial stage, was largely due to the policy advocated by Sir Syed Ahmed Khan. It gradually became something like ‘antogonism’ when the British bureaucracy, alarmed at the growing influence of the Congress as a nationaliser, deliberately adopted a policy of ‘divide and rule.’
  - In October 1906, a group of Muslim elites called the **Shimla Deputation**, led by the **Agha Khan**, met **Lord Minto** and demanded **separate electorates** for the Muslims and **representation in excess of their numerical strength** in view of ‘the value of the contribution’ Muslims were making ‘to the defence of the empire’.
    - He promised them the same. The die was thus cast and the foundations of Muslim communalism were laid.
- Intensity of the Swadeshi movement and the spread of extremism had forced upon the administration some new thoughts on constitutional reforms, while militant nationalism reinforced this process.
  - When the Morley Minto Reforms were announced in 1909, many of these people believed it was **because of fear generated by revolutionary activities.**
  - As one historian argues, the appointment of Lord S.P. Sinha as the law Member in the viceroy’s executive council was surely the result of pressures generated by terrorist activities.
- **John Morley**, the Liberal Secretary of State for India, and the Conservative Viceroy of India, **Minto**, believed that cracking down on uprising in Bengal was necessary but not sufficient for restoring stability to the British Raj after Lord Curzon’s partitioning of Bengal.
  - Then the Secretary of State Morley’s budget speech of 1906 indicated that representative government was going to be introduced in India.
    - He urged Viceroy Lord Minto to balance the unpopular Bengal partition with reforms.
    - Although partition was declared to be a settled fact, there was also a realisation that India could no longer be ruled with a “cast iron bureaucracy”. Indians should be given some share of power. There were three aspects of this new policy:
      - Outright repression,
      - Concessions to rally the moderates,
      - Matched by divide and rule through separate electorates for the Muslims.
  - Morley and Minto **offered a bait of reforms** in the Legislative Councils and in the beginning of 1906  began discussing them with the Moderate leadership of the Congress.
    - The Moderates agreed to cooperate with the Government and discuss reforms even while a vigorous popular movement, which the Government was trying to suppress, was going on in the country. The result was a total split in the nationalist ranks.
  - If the Indian Councils Act of 1892 was passed to take the wind out of the sails of the Congress movement, that of 1909 was taken into hands by the Indian Government to rally to its side the Moderates in the Indian National Congress and the Muslims in order to buttress the authority of British bureaucracy.
- A Committee of the Executive Council of the Viceroy had studied the subject and the Government of India sent a despatch to England embodying its proposals.
  - Morley sent back the proposals to be referred to the Local Governments in India for public criticism.
  - The Bill was drafted, and after the approval of the Cabinet, passed by the Parliament in February 1909, to become the Indian Councils Act of 1909.

**Provisions of the Act:**

- The size and functions of the Legislatures, both at the Centre and in the Provinces, was enlarged.
- The **member of the Legislative Councils**, both at the Center and in the provinces, were to be of four categories i.e.
  - **_ex officio_ members** (Governor General and the members of their Executive Councils),
  - **nominated official members** (those nominated by the Governor General and were government officials),
  - **nominated non-official members** (nominated by the Governor General but were not government officials) and
  - **elected members** (elected by different categories of Indian people).
- The **Governor-General**, with the approval of the Secretary of State for India, **made regulations** for how members of legislative councils were nominated or elected nominated, and their qualifications.
  - Regulations made in accordance with the Act could not be exercised until laid before both Houses of Parliament, so that either house might object.
- The number of **elected members** in the **Imperial Legislative Council** and the **Provincial Legislative Councils** was **increased**.
- **Central Legislature:**
  - The number of ‘additional’ members here was now raised at the maximum to 60.
  - The **Legislature** was thus to consist of **69 members** of whom 37 officials and 32 non-officials.
    - Of the officials:
      - 9 ex Officio members:
        - Governor General,
        - seven ordinary members (Executive Councillors),
        - one extraordinary member.
      - 28 nominated by the Governor General.
    - Of the 32 non-officials:
      - 5 nominated by the Governor General
      - **27 were to be elected.**
  - For the elected members, it was declared that the territorial representation did not suit India and that “representation by classes and interests is the only practicable method of embodying the elective principle in the constitution of the Indian Legislative Councils.”
    - Thus, of the **27 elected members**,
      - **13 were to come from the General Electorates** consisting of:
        - non official members of the following legislatures sending 2 members each:
          - Bombay,
          - Madras,
          - Bengal and
          - United Provinces
        - non official members of the following legislatures sending 1 member each:
          - Central Provinces,
          - Assam,
          - Bihar and Orissa,
          - Punjab
          - Burma.
      - Of the remaining 14:
        - 12 were to come from **class Electorates**;
          - **6** of them coming one each from the **Landholders’ constituencies** in the six provinces of Bombay, Madras, Bengal, Bihar and Orissa, United Provinces and the Central Provinces; and
          - **6** being returned by the **separate Muslim constituencies**– one each from Madras, Bombay, United Provinces and Bihar and Orissa (4) and two from Bengal.
        - The remaining **2** were to be returned from the **Special electorates** by **British capitalists.**,
          - one each from the Bengal and Bombay Chambers of Commerce.
  - The elected members were to be **indirectly elected**.
    - The local bodies were to elect an electoral college, which in turn would elect members of provincial legislatures, who in turn would elect members of the central legislature.
- **Provincial Legislatures:**
  - The membership of the Legislative Councils of the different provinces as enlarged under the Act of 1909 was as follows:
    - Burma, 16;
    - Eastern Bengal and Assam, 41;
    - Bengal, 52;
    - Punjab, 25;
    - Madras, Bombay and United Provinces, 47 each;
  - The Act provided for **non official majorities in the provinces**.
    - However, this did not mean non official elected majorities, as **some of the non officials were to be nominated by the Governors** and through these the official control over the Council was retained.
    - As nominated members always sided with the Government, the officials were ‘in a manner of speaking in the majority’.
    - Hence the **overall non-elected majority remained.**
  - The elected members in the Provincial Legislatures were to be returned by different constituencies.
    - In Bombay, for instance, out of the 21 elected members:
      - 6 were to be returned by the Special electorates consisting of the Bombay Corporation and the Bombay University etc.,
      - 8 were to be returned by the General electorates consisting of District Boards and Municipalties etc. and
      - 7 were to be returned by Class electorates consisting of **Muslims** (returning 4) and the **Landlords** (returning 3).
  - The **membership of Executive Councils** of Bengal, Madras and Bombay was raised to 4 and the Government was empowered to constitute similar Councils for the Lieutenant Governors as well.
- Besides separate electorates for the Muslims (only Muslims should vote for candidates for the Muslim seats), **representation in excess of the strength of their population** was accorded to the **Muslims**.
  - Also, the **income qualification for Muslim voters was kept lower** than that for Hindus.
  - It was because Muslims had expressed serious concern that a “first past the post” electoral system, like that of Britain, would leave them permanently subject to Hindu majority rule.
- **Functions of Legislative Councils:**
  - The functions of the Legislative Councils, both at the Centre and in the Provinces, were **enlarged**.
  - The members were given the **right of discussion** and **asking supplementary questions**.
  - **Detailed rules** were laid down concerning the **discussion of budgets** in the Central Legislature.
  - Members, though not empowered to vote, were **empowered to move resolutions** concerning
    - additional grants to the Local Governments,
    - any alteration in taxation,
    - on a new loan, which might have been proposed in the Budget.
  - The Budget before its submission in the Council, had to be referred to its Committee consisting of the Finance member (Chairman) and non officials and nominated members on a 50 : 50 basis.
  - Members could discuss matters of general public interest, moving resolutions on them and could also vote.
    - But the President was empowered to disallow the whole or a part of such resolutions, without assigning any reason.
    - Nor was the Government obliged to accept such resolutions, even if passed, whether concerning public interest or concerning financial statements.
  - Certain subjects which the **members could not discuss:**
    - the foreign relations of the Government of India and its relations with the Indian Princes,
    - a matter under adjudication of a court of law,
    - expenditure on state railways,
    - interest on debt etc.
- **One Indian** was to be appointed to the **viceroy’s executive council** (**Satyendra Prasad Sinha** was the first to be appointed in 1909).
  - Earlier in August 1907 two Indians- K.G. Gupta and Syed Hussain Bilgrami-were made members of the **Secretary of State’s India Council.**
- The Indian Councils Act served as the governance structure of India for a decade. It was **modified** by the **Government of India Act 1912**,
  - to clarify the authority of the Governor of Bengal,
  - to create a legislative council for the new province of Bihar and Orissa,
  - to dispense with Parliamentary review of the creation of new legislative councils for provinces under a lieutenant-governor and
  - to permit the creation of legislative councils in provinces under chief commissioners.

**Evaluation:**

- The reforms of 1909 afforded no answer and could afford no answer to the Indian political problem.
  - **Lord Morley** made it clear that colonial self-government (as demanded by the Congress) was not suitable for India, and he was against introduction of parliamentary or responsible government in India. He said, “_If it could be said that led directly or indirectly to the establishment of a parliamentary system in India, I, for one, would have nothing at all to do with it.”_
  - Narrow franchises, indirect elections, limited powers of the Legislative Councils made a joke of representative government.
  - The act introduced the principle of election, but under various constraints.
    - Details of seat allocation and electoral qualifications were left to be decided by the local governments, and this left enough space for bureaucratic manipulation.
  - The electorate was based on high property qualifications and therefore was heavily restricted. There were disparities too, as income qualifications for the Muslims were lower than those for the Hindus.
  - The Government of India was given the general power to disallow any candidate from contesting the election on suspicion of being politically dangerous.
  - The real power remained with the Government and the Councils were left with no functions but criticism.
- The ‘constitutional’ reforms were, in fact, **aimed at dividing the nationalist ranks** by confusing the Moderates and at checking the growth of unity among Indians through the obnoxious instrument of **separate electorates.**
  - The Government aimed at rallying the Moderates and the Muslims against the rising tide of nationalism.
  - **Introduction of separate electorates** for Muslims was the new problem created in Indian politics by which, according to Jawaharlal Nehru, a “_political barrier was created round them, isolating them from the rest of India_.”
    - The barrier was a small one at first for the electorates were very limited but with every extension of franchise it grew.
    - The system of separate electorate was done to encourage the notion that the political, economic and cultural interests of Hindus and Muslims were separate and not common.
  - The officials and the Muslim leaders often talked of the entire community when they talked of the separate electorates, but in reality it meant the appeasement of a small section of the Muslim elite only.
  - Congress considered separate electorate to be undemocratic and hindering the development of a shared Hindu-Muslim Indian national feeling.
  - The granting of separate electorate for Muslim provided an official legitimacy to their minority status and the separate political identity of the Indian Muslims.
    - The subsequent evolution of this Muslim identity from minority status to nationhood took a long and tortuous trajectory.
  - The granting of this privilege of separate electorate by the colonial state in the Morley-Minto reform of 1909 elevated them to the status of an “all-India political category“, but positioned them as a “perpetual minority” in the Indian body politic.
- Other communities claimed to have rendered “better services to the Empire” than the Muslims and yet had not been shown any special consideration.
  - The Sikhs thus fought for their rights and special representation was also conceded to them in 1919.
  - It was a signal for other communities to intensify their agitation.
  - Thus the Harijans, the Indian Christians, the Europeans and the Anglo Indians also got separate representation or reservation by the Act of 1935.
  - The national unity forged through centuries was thus shattered with one blow.
  - It perpetuated division of creeds and classes which meant the creating of camps organised against each other and taught them to think as partisans and not as citizens.
  - It was a very serious hindrance to the development of self governing principle.”
  - Lord Morley was right when he wrote to Lord Minto that **in granting separate electorates “we are sowing dragon’s teeth and the harvest will be bitter.”**
- The system of election was too indirect and it gave the impression of infiltration of legislators through a number of sieves.
  - The people elected members of local bodies, which elected members of an electoral college, which in turn elected members of the provincial legislatures, who in turn elected members of the Central Legislature.
  - There was absolutely no connection between the supposed primary voter and the man who sits as his representative on the Legislative Council. In such circumstances, there can be no responsibility upon and no political education for the people who nominally exercise a vote.
- While parliamentary forms were introduced, **no responsibility was conceded**, which sometimes led to thoughtless and irresponsible criticism of the Government.
  - Only some members like Gokhale put to constructive use the opportunity to debate in the councils by demanding universal primary education, attacking repressive policies and drawing attention to the plight of indentured labour and Indian workers in South Africa.
- The reforms of 1909 gave to the people of the country a shadow rather than substance. _The people had demanded self-government but what they were given was ‘benevolent despotism_’.
- It was the most short-lived of all constitutional reforms in British India and had to be revised within ten years.

**The Act of 1909 was still important:**

- It effectively allowed the election of Indians to the various legislative councils in India for the first time, though previously some Indians had been appointed to legislative councils.
- The introduction of the electoral principle laid the groundwork for a parliamentary system even though this was contrary to the intent of Morley.

## **Montagu-Chelmsford Reforms and Government of India Act, 1919**

**Background:**

- The **Minto Morley Reforms** were passed not with the intention of establishing a parliamentary system in India but with intention of buttressing the authority of the British bureaucracy by rallying to its side the Moderates and the Muslims.
  - The **Reforms of 1909 did not satisfy any section of the people.**
  - The Indian National Congress expressed its dissatisfaction at:
    - the excessive and unfairly preponderant share of representation given to the followers of one particular religion,
    - the unjust distinctions made between Muslims and non Muslims in the matter of electorates, the franchise and the qualifications of the candidates,
    - the wide, arbitrary and unreasonable disqualifications and restrictions for candidates seeking election to the Councils,
    - the general distrust of the educated classes,
    - the unsatisfactory composition of the non-official majorities in the Provincial Councils, rendering them ineffective and unreal.
  - Certain circumstance led to **discontentment among the Muslims also.**
    - A proof of it is to be found in the modification of the constitution of the Muslim League.
      - In March 1913 its goal was laid down to be “_the promotion among Indians of Loyalty to the British Crown, the protection of the rights of the Muslims and, without detriment to the foregoing objects, the attainment of the system of self government suitable to India._”
    - As the Muslims could not come to a settlement with the British Government in regarded to the condition on which a Muslim University was to be founded at Aligarh, the Muslims felt greatly hurt, as also at the **annulment of the partition of Bengal in 1911.**
    - The hostile attitude of England towards Turkey in the Turco-Italian War (1911-12) was viewed with dismay by the Muslims in India.
    - The Balkan Wars of 1912-13 were considered by them as a great conspiracy of the Christian Powers against Turkey.
    - This estrangement of the Muslims with British Government had one salutary effect, namely, that it brought the Hindus and the Muslims closer. The Congress League rapprochement resulted in the Lucknow Pact (1916).
  - So great was the discontent among the people of India with the Minto Morley Reforms that the British Government had to resort to repressive measures to suppress the rising tide of discontent through:
    - The Indian Press Act of 1910,
    - the Seditious Meetings Act of 1911 and
    - the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act of 1913.
    - The Defence of India Act of 1915 (provided for the trial of revolutionary offenders by a strong bench without appeal).
- As the **World War I** went on, the **emergence of the doctrine of self determination**, deeply influenced Indian public opinion.
  - If the war was being fought to make the world safe for democracy, it was hoped that it would at least put India on the road to self government.
- Under the circumstances, the question of further constitutional reforms did not brook delay. In December, 1916 a joint scheme prepared by the Congress and the Muslim League, the outcome of the Lucknow Pact, was put forward.
- **Montagu’s Statement of 20 August 1917:**
  - Montagu, the new Secretary of State made a statement in the House of Commons regarding the goal of British Government in India. he announced:
    - _“The policy of His Majesty’s Government, with which the Government of India are in complete accord, is that of the **increasing association of Indians in every branch of the administration and gradual development of self governing institutions** with a view to the **progressive realisation of responsible Government in India** as an integral part of the British Empire. They have decided that substantial steps in this direction should be taken as soon as possible….I would add that progress in this policy can only be achieved by successive stages. The British Government and the Government of India, on whom the responsibility lies for the welfare and advancement of Indian peoples, must be judges of the time and measure of each advance, and they must be guided by the co-operation received from those upon whom new opportunities of services will thus be conferred and by the extent to which it is found that confidence can reposed in their sense of responsibility.”_
  - The Declaration eased the tense Indian atmosphere for the time being at least.
  - But, there was a section of people in India to whom the declaration failed to satisfy.
    - No definite time was prescribed, by which India would reach her goal.
    - Nor was there any standard laid down, by which one could decide whether a certain stage for further reforms had been reached or not.
    - It was indeed insulting to India that the British were to the sole judge to decide whether India was capable of a particular set up or not.
  - The Secretary of State came to India in November 1917 and discussed his scheme of reforms with the Viceroy, Lord Chelmsford, and some eminent British civil servants and Indian politicians.
    - A **committee** was appointed which together with the Viceroy helped Montagu prepare the draft of a reform scheme which was published in July 1918 and is called **Montagu-Chelmsford (Montford) Report** on the basis of which the **Government of India Act 1919** was drafted.

**Preamble of the Government of India Act, 1919**

- The Act laid down in its Preamble the principles on which the reforms were to be progressively carried out in India.
- The Preamble contained the following points:
  - British India is to remain an integral part of the British Empire.
  - Responsible Government in British India is the objective of the declared policy of Parliament.
  - Responsible Government is capable of progressive realisation only.
  - In order to achieve Responsible Government, it is necessary to provide for:
    - the increasing association of the Indians in every branch of administration and
    - the gradual development of self governing institutions.
  - Concurrently with the development of self governing institutions in the provinces, it is expedient to give to provinces in provincial matters the highest measure of independence of the Government of India.
- **Significance of Preamble:**
  - In Preamble, what was already declared by Montagu was now given a definite legal shape.
  - The sovereignty of the British Parliament over India was reasserted.
  - The country was told in clear terms of the basis of the future British action.

**Provisions of the Government of India Act, 1919**

**Changes in the Home Government:**

- The **Secretary of State for India** who used to be paid out of the Indian revenues was now to be **paid by the British Exchequer.**
  - Thus an injustice dating from 1793 was undone.
- Some of his functions were taken away from him and given to the **High Commissioner for India** who was to be appointed and paid by the Government of India.
  - This new functionary acted as the **agent of the Governor General in Council**.
  - He was to be incharge of the Stores Department, the Indian Students Department, etc.
- The **control of the Secretary of State was reduced in the provincial sphere** in India in so far as **Transferred Subjects** were concerned but his control over the Centre remained as complete as before.

**Changes in the Government of India (Centre):**

**(A) Executive:**

- The governor-general was to be the chief executive authority.
- The Act **did not introduce responsible government at the Centre** though Indians were to have greater influence there.
- The **number of Indians** in the Governor General’s Executives Council was **raised to 3 in a Council of 8.**
- The Indian members were entrusted with departments like that of Law, Education, Labour, Health and Industries.
- The new scheme of Government envisaged a **division of Subjects into the Central List and the Provincial List.**
  - A List of Central subjects was drawn up which were to be administered by the Governor General in Council.
  - **Central List:**
    - Those subjects which were of national importance or which related to more than one province, such as:
      - Foreign Affairs, Defence, Political Relations, Posts and Telegraphs, Public Debt, Communications, Civil and Criminal Law and Procedure, etc.
    - Any subject not specially transferred to the provinces was a Central subject.
  - **Provincial List:**
    - Subjects of provincial importance, such as
      - Public Health, Local Self Government, Education, Medical Administration, Land Revenue Administration, Water Supply, Famine Relief, Law and Order, Agriculture, etc.
  - The revenue resources were divided between the centre and the provinces, with land revenue going to the provinces, and income tax remaining with the centre.
- **Analysis:**
  - Though a step was taken towards increasing association of Indians by raising their strength to 3, yet the departments assigned to them were comparatively unimportant.
  - Nor were these members made responsible to the Legislative.
  - The division of subjects into two lists was not clear-cut or based on proper consideration.
  - Although all subjects in the Provincial List were provincial for purposes of administration, that was not the case for purpose of legislation.
  - The chief executive authority still remained with the Governor-General. He exercised full control over his Councillors and enjoyed vast powers over the country.
    - Thus the wishes of the people of the country in respect of the appointment, powers and functions of the Governor General were ignored in the Act.

**(B) Legislative:**

- The Act set up a **bicameral legislature at the Centre** in place of the Imperial Council consisting of one House.
- The two Houses now were to be: Council of State and Central Legislative Assembly.
  - The Council of State had tenure of 5 years and had only male members.
  - The Central Legislative Assembly had tenure of 3 years.
- **The Council of State:**
  - Upper House was to consist of 60 members:
    - 26 were to be nominated by the Governor General:
      - 20 officials and 6 non-officials,
    - 34 were to be elected, (**introducing an elected majority**):
      - 20 to be elected by General constituencies,
      - 10 by the **Muslims**,
      - 3 by the **Europeans**, and
      - 1 by the **Sikh** constituencies.
  - The Council of State was renewed partially every year, though a member held his seat for five years.
  - Its President was to be nominated by the Viceroy.
  - **Women** were **not entitled to become its members.**
  - The governor General could address the House, and he could summon, prorogue or dissolve the House.
  - **The franchise was extremely restricted.**
    - Only those paying an income tax on the minimum income of Rs. 10,000 a year or those paying a minimum land revenue of Rs. 750 a year were entitled to vote.
    - Either a person must be on the Senate of a University or he must have some past experience in some Legislative Council of India, or he must be title holder.
    - Out of the entire population of India in 1920 of 24 crores not more than 17,364 persons possessed the requisite qualifications for a vote.
- **The Central Legislative Assembly:**
  - The Lower House was to consist of 145 members.
    - 41 nominated:
      - 26 officials
      - 15 non officials
    - 104 elected:
      - 52 by the General constituencies,
      - 32 by the Communal constituencies:
        - 30 by the **Muslims**,
        - 2 by the **Sikhs**.
      - 20 by the **Special constituencies:**
        - 7 by the **landholders**,
        - 9 by the **Europeans,**
        - 4 by the **Indian Commercial community.**
  - The life of the Assembly was to be three years but it could be extended by the Governor General.
  - The franchise here was restricted (as per property/ tax/ land revenue) though as compared to Council of State it was not so high:
    - The number of persons who thus became entitled to vote stood at 909,874 in 1920.
- The distribution of seats among the different provinces was made on the basis of their importance and not on the basis of their population.
  - Bombay and Madras were granted 16 seats each though the population of Bombay was only half of that of Madras. The reason here was the commercial importance of Bombay.
- **Powers of the Central Legislature.**
  - The Central Legislature, constituted of the above mentioned two Houses, was supposed to have been given very wide powers.
  - It could legislate for the whole of British India, for the Indian subjects and servants of the Government, whether inside or outside the country.
  - It could repeal or amend any law already existing in the country.
  - The members were given:
    - the right to move resolutions and motions for adjournment of the House,
    - to consider urgent questions of public importance immediately.
    - the right to ask questions and supplementaries.
    - right to as Short notice questions,
    - the **right of freedom of speech.**
- **Restrictions on the Legislature:**
  - There were certain restrictions imposed on the Legislature.
  - In certain cases, **previous sanction of the Governor General was required** for the introduction of a bill such as:
    - Amendment or repeal of an existing law or an ordinance of the Governor General,
    - Foreign relations and the relations with the Indian States,
    - Discipline or maintenance of the military, naval and the air forces,
    - Public debt and public revenue and
    - Religion, religious rites and usages of the people.
  - Further, if the Governor General felt that and bill affects the **safety or tranquility of British India**, he could prevent its consideration.
  - If on the advice of the Governor General the Legislature refused to pass a law, the Governor General could pass it himself, subject to the sanction of the Crown.
  - He could **make and promulgate ordinances** in cases of emergency which could last for six months.
  - His assent was essential for the enactment of law passed by the legislature.
  - Thus the vetoing power of the Governor General was real and was actually exercised.
  - **Budget:**
    - The Government would submit proposals for appropriation in the shape of demands for grant in the Legislative Assembly.
    - Certain items were subject to the vote of the Assembly, others were open for discussion and some could not even be discussed much less voted upon.
- **The Act of 1919 introduced responsive and not responsible government at the Centre:**
  - No vote of no-confidence by the Legislature means the members of the Executive Council of the Governor General were irremovable.
  - But that did not mean that they could ride roughshod over the wishes of the Legislature. In fact, they did respond to the wishes of the Legislature and through it to the wishes of the people.
  - Some of the members of the Legislature were put on the standing committees such as that of Public Accounts and Finance and here they got considerable opportunity to influence the governmental policy.
  - Moreover, they could expose the Government by putting it questions, supplementaries and moving motions of adjournment.
  - They could also reject the budget and move and pass resolutions against the Government.
  - So the Executive Councillors had to respond to the wishes of the members of the Legislature.

**Changes in Provincial Government—Introduction of Dyarchy:**

- One of the principles enunciated by the Montford Report was: “_The provinces were the domain in which the earlier steps towards the progressive realisation of responsible government should be taken._”
- To give effect to this principle, the Act introduced what is called Dyarchy in the Provinces.

**(A) Executive:**

- **Dyarchy**, i.e., rule of two—executive councillors and popular ministers—was introduced. The governor was to be the executive head in the province.
- Under the system of **Dyarchy**, the subject to be dealt with by the Provincial Government were divided into two parts:
  - **Reserved subjects:**
    - They were administered by the Governor with the help of the members of the Executive Council who were nominated by him and who were **not to be responsible to the Legislature.**
    - The Reserved subjects were:
      - Land Revenue,
      - Famine Relief,
      - Justice, Police,
      - Criminal Tribes,
      - Printing Presses,
      - Irrigation and Waterways,
      - Mines, Factories, Electricity,
      - Labour Welfare, Industrial Disputes,
      - Excluded Areas,
      - Public Services etc.
  - **Transferred subjects:**
    - They were administered by the Governor acting with ministers appointed by him from among the elected members of the Legislature and who **were to be responsible to the Legislature and were to hold office during his pleasure.**
    - The ministers were to be responsible to the legislature and had to resign if a no-confidence motion was passed against them by the legislature.
    - The secretary of state and the governor-general could interfere in respect of “reserved” subjects while in respect of the “transferred” subjects; the scope for their interference was restricted.
    - In case of failure of constitutional machinery in the province the governor could take over the administration of “transferred” subjects also.
    - Transferred subjects:
      - Education (other than European and Anglo Indian Education),
      - Libraries, Museums,
      - Local Self Government, Medical Relief,
      - Public Health and Sanitation, Agriculture,
      - Co-operative Societies,
      - Veterinary Department, Fisheries,
      - Public Works,
      - Excise,
      - Industries,
      - Religious and Charitable Endowments, etc.
  - The law did not require meetings of all ministers together to take decisions on all Transferred subjects. The Governor dealt with each minister individually.
  - On matters of common concern, particularly on the allocation of the revenues, there was joint consultation between the Reserved and Transferred halves of the Government, the Governor presiding and having the last word of the subject.

**(b) Legislature:**

- **Provincial Legislative Councils** were further expanded:
  - Their size was increased, their total membership varying from province to province.
  - Of the total number of the members of a Provincial Council:
    - **at least 70% were to be elected**,
    - **not more than 20% were to be officials,**
    - the remaining were to be nominated non officials.
  - 70% of the members were to be elected.
- The system of election introduced for the Provincial Councils was **direct**, the primary voters electing the members.
  - However, **high property qualifications, the communal and class electorates** and **special weightage to certain communities** figured in the provincial franchise.
  - **Women** were also given the **right to vote.**
- **The functions of the Provincial Council:**
  - It was enlarged.
  - The members enjoyed:
    - the **freedom of speech,**
    - the right to move resolutions,
    - the right to ask questions and supplementaries,
    - the right to initiate legislation concerning any provincial subject, though **every bill passed required the approval of the Governor.**
  - The members could reject the budget, though the Governor could restore it, if necessary.
  - The governor could veto bills and issue ordinances.

**Criticism of Dyarchy:**

- Diarchy was introduced in the provinces on April 1, 1921, and continued in operation till April 1937. During its operation, the limitations and defects of Diarchy came to the surface.
- The actual **division of subjects under the two heads of Reserved and Transferred was illogical** and irrational, the result being that neither a Minister, nor an Executive Councillor could work independently of the other.
  - Thus, while Agriculture was a transferred subject, Irrigation was kept as Reserved, though the two for obvious reasons cannot be separated.
  - Similarly, industry was Transferred, while Water, Power Factories and Mines were kept as Reserved.
- It was **not possible at times to have unity of purpose between the two branches of administration.**
  - For instance, when there was agitation in regard to the Sikh Gurudwaras, the aim of the Member in charge of law and order, which was Reserved subject, was to introduce certain legislative measures to meet the situation, but this he could not do, as the legislation in this connection could be introduced only by the Minister in-charge of Religious Endowments, which was a Transferred subject.
- At times there was such a confusion that the authorities could not decide whether a particular subject belonged to one department or the other.
  - For example: an enquiry was started in the Department of Agriculture on the question of the fragmentation of holdings.
  - When the Report was submitted in the following year, all of a sudden it was discovered that the question should have been handled by the Revenue Department, to which the matter was now referred.
  - But here too, when the question had engaged the attention of the Revenue Department for two years, it was discovered that the subject after all belonged to the Co-operative Department.
- There was no love lost between the two halves of the Government.
  - The ministers were the representatives of the people while the members of the Executive Council belonged to the bureaucracy.
  - Friction between them was inevitable. At times the Ministers and the Executive Councilors condemned one another in public.
  - As a rule, the Governor backed the members of the Executive Council against the Ministers.
- The **position of the Ministers was weak in another way**.
  - They **had to serve two masters,** Governor and the Legislative Council.
  - A Minister was appointed by the Governor and dismissed at his will.
    - He was responsible to the Legislature for the administration of his department.
    - He could not retain his if a legislature passed a vote of no confidence against him.
  - From point of view of practical politics, the Ministers cared more for the Governor than the Legislature.
  - There were no strong parties in the provincial legislatures. The result was that no Minister had a majority to back him in office.
  - He had always to depend upon the backing and support of official bloc in the legislature and this he could only get if the Governor was happy with him.
  - The result was that the Ministers sank to the position of glorified secretaries and were always at the beck and call of the Governors.
- The **Governor did not encourage the principle of joint responsibility amongst the Ministers**.
  - The latter never worked as a team. They were at times pitched against one another.
  - In 1928, Feroz Khan Noon, a Punjab Minister, publicly criticized and condemned the action of his Hindu colleague.
- In **most important matters, the Ministers were not even consulted**, as for instance in the case of Gandhiji’s arrest.
  - The repressive policy against the non-cooperation movement was planned, and executed but the Ministers were neither consulted nor did they even know what actually the Governor was planning to do.
  - They, in the words of CR. Das, “were only dumb spectators, who could neither speak nor say anything.”
- A Minister **did not have the required control on the services under his own department.**
  - His Own Secretary had a weekly interview with the Governor and therefore his opinion carried greater weight than that of the Minister.
  - Whenever there was a difference of opinion between the Minister and his permanent Secretary or between the Minister and the Commissioner of a Division or the head of the department, the matter had to be referred to the Governor, who always supported the officials against the Minister.
- The appointment, salary, suspension, dismissal and transfer of the members of All-India Services was under the control of the Secretary of State for India.
  - These persons continued to be under the control of the Secretary of State even if they held charge in the Transferred departments.
  - They, in consequence, did not care for the Ministers. The Ministers had no power to choose officers of their own liking.
- All the so-called nation building departments were transferred to the Ministers but they were given no money for them.
  - The result was that the Ministers had to depend upon the goodwill of the Finance Member.
  - As a member of the bureaucracy, the Finance Member had little sympathy will the aspirations of the people as represented by the Ministers.
  - He cared more for the needs of the Reserved departments than for the Transferred departments.
- All these factors led to the failure of the Diarchy and as per recommendation of the Simon Commission, it was abolished in the provinces in the Government of India Act, 1935.
- **Other hindrances in the way of its successful working of the Act of 1919:**
  - The political atmosphere in the country was surcharged with suspicion and distrust on account of terrible happenings in the Panjab and elsewhere, and the attitude of the British Government towards Turkey.
  - The monsoon failed in 1920 and added to the misery of the people.
  - Slump also came in the market with the result that the finances of both Central and Provincial governments were upset as also the favourable balance of trade of India.
  - Under the Meston Award, the Provincial Governments were required to make certain annual contributions to the Government of India but the provinces which themselves were in financial difficulties.
  - The financial crisis in the provinces and the atmosphere of suspicion and distrust boded ill for the successful working of the new constitution.
  - While, on the one hand, the Government dangled the carrot of constitutional reforms, on the other hand, it decided to arm itself with extraordinary powers to suppress any discordant voices against the reforms.
    - In March 1919, it passed the **Rowlatt Act** even though every single Indian member of the Central Legislative Council opposed it.
    - This Act authorised the Government to imprison any person without trial and conviction in a court of law, thus enabling the Government to suspend the right of habeas corpus which had been the foundation of civil liberties in Britain.
- **Other criticism:**
  - Communal representation and reservations were not only retained, but also considerably extended.
    - In addition to the Muslims, Sikhs were granted separate electorate too, while seats were reserved for the non-Brahmans in Madras and the ‘depressed classes’ were offered nominated seats in the legislatures at all levels.
  - For Carl Bridge, on the other hand, these were measures to “safeguard the essentials of the British position” in India.
  - For Tomlinson, it was an attempt to mobilise “an influential section of Indian opinion … to support the Raj“.
  - The major problem of the reform, as Peter Robb has identified, was its being “limited by ideas of continuing British presence“.
  - Many Indians by this time had moved beyond the idea of self-government within the empire. Their new goal was swaraj, which was soon going to be defined as complete independence.
  - The reform therefore failed to satisfy Indian political opinions, and prevent the eventual mass movement.
- **Some positive aspects of the Act:**
  - For the first time in the history of British rule it provided for transfer of power, even though the transfer was halting and the power extremely limited.
  - Previous measures had enabled Indians increasingly to control their legislatures but now their Government…Now Indians were to govern as leaders of the elected majorities in their legislatures, and responsible to them.
  - Though dyarchy has been condemned out of hands, it would be wrong to say that dyarchy brought no constitutional progress.
  - The electorates were considerably enlarged to 5 .5 million for the provinces and 1.5 million for the imperial legislature.
  - Philip Woods, on one hand, has argued that the ideas behind the reforms “were crucial in establishing parliamentary democracy in India and, thereby, in beginning the process of decolonisation“.”
  - The Cambridge School has in a different way sought to establish a connection between the constitutional reforms of 1909 and 1919 and the emergence of mass politics after World War One.: As the electorate was widened, the Indian leaders were forced to operate in a democratic way and seek the support of the masses.
    - This interpretation does not necessarily explain the mass upsurge under Mahatma Gandhi. A major theme of Gandhi’s non-cooperation programme launched in December 1920 was the boycott of the new councils.
    - Gandhian philosophy, was based on a critique of Western civil society; the mass movement he engineered had an altogether different logic, as his mission was to liberate Indian politics from this constricted arena of constiturionalism.

**Reception in India:**

- **The Act of 1919 had the following major defects from the nationalist point of view:**
  - The absence of even partial responsible government at the Centre,
  - The consolidation of ‘separate electorates’.
    - Although the Montford Report had declared that communal ‘separate electorates’ was ‘a very serious hindrance to the development of the self governing principle, yet ‘separate electorates’ came to be a permanent feature of the Indian political life.
  - The introduction of dyarchy in the provinces was too complicated to be smoothly worked.
- The Congress met in a special session in August 1918 at **Bombay** under **Hasan Imam’s presidency** and declared the reforms to be “disappointing” and “unsatisfactory” and demanded effective self-government instead.
- The 1919 reforms did not satisfy political demands in India.
  - The British repressed opposition, and restrictions on the press and on movement were re-enacted in the Rowlatt Acts introduced in 1919.
  - These measures were rammed through the Legislative Council with the unanimous opposition of the Indian members.
  - Several members of the council including Jinnah resigned in protest.
  - These measures were widely seen throughout India of the betrayal of strong support given by the population for the British war effort.
- Gandhi launched a nationwide protest against the Rowlatt Acts with the strongest level of protest in the Punjab. An apparently unwitting example of violation of rules against the gathering of people led to the massacre at Jalianwala Bagh in Amritsar in April 1919. This tragedy galvanised such political leaders as Nehru and Gandhi and the masses who followed them to press for further action.
- Montagu ordered an inquiry into the events at Amritsar by Lord Hunter.
  - The **Hunter Inquiry** recommended that General Dyer, who commanded the troops, be dismissed, leading to Dyer’s sacking.
  - Many British citizens supported Dyer, whom they considered had not received fair treatment from the Hunter Inquiry.
- As per Gandhi Ji: _“The Montford Reforms…were only a method of further draining India of her wealth and of prolonging her servitude.”_

**Later on:**

- The Montagu-Chelmsford report stated that there should be a review after 10 years.
- Sir John Simon headed the committee (Simon Commission) responsible for the review which recommended further constitutional change.
- Three round table conferences were held in London in 1930, 1931 and 1932 with representation of the major interests.
  - Gandhi attended the 1931 round table after negotiations with the British Government.
  - The major disagreement between Congress and the British was separate electorates for each community which Congress opposed but which were retained in Ramsay MacDonald’s Communal Award.
- A new Government of India Act 1935 was passed continuing the move towards self-government first made in the Montagu-Chelmsford Report.
