:::details  Lord Irwin Statement
- 31 Oct. 1929. Lord Irwin announced on behalf of the British Government that the natural constitutional progress ofindiawas the attainment of Dominion Status. The Viceroy did not name a specific time for the award. The Congress Party indicated Its willingness to cooperate in formulating a Dominion constitution as a test of the government's sincerity which in the end proved minimal. In November debates in both Houses, the measure was tacitly approved, but in such  away that Congress rejected the Declaration
- 23 Dec. 1929. Lord Irwin met with Gandhi, Jawahar1al Nehru , Vallabhbjai Patel , Mohammed Ali Jinnah , and Tel Bahadur Sapru at New DeIhl but could not arrive at an agreement for framing a constitution under Dominion Status. The Congress also refused to attend the London Round Table Conference in London due to communal division and the lack of British support for Indian freedom. At the ensuing 1930 annual meeting of the Congress Party held at Lahore, the Congress declared itself for independence rather than Dominion Status and authorized a campaign of civil disobedience.
