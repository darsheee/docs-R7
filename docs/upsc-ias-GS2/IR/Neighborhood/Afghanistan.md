# India-Afghanistan relations

## History 
#### **Ancient:**

-   The relations between the people of Afghanistan and India traces to the Indus Valley Civilisation.
-   Following Alexander the Great’s brief occupation, the successor state of the Seleucid Empire controlled the region known today as Afghanistan.
-   The Mauryans brought Buddhism from India and controlled the area south of the Hindu Kush; much of Afghanistan has been influenced by Buddhist, Hindu and Zoroastrian cultures until the arrival of Islam in the 7th century. But despite many Afghans converting to Islam, the Muslims and Hindus lived side by side.
-   In the timeless Buddhist symbols of Aynak and Bamyan of Afghanistan and in the majestic monuments of Delhi, in Indian cultures, arts, languages, literatures, foods and festivals, both nations see the imprint of bilateral timeless relations.

#### **Colonial period:**

-   2 Anglo-afghan wars 1839-1842 & in 1870-1880 fought between British India and Afghanistan.
-   Boundary line known as Durand Line was drawn between Afghan and British territories, But the Durand Agreement (1893) failed to keep peace and soon there were tribal uprisings which continued till 1898.
-   Curzon, the viceroy between 1899 and 1905, followed a policy of withdrawal and concentration. British troops withdrew from advanced posts which were replaced by tribal troops, trained and commanded by British officers.
-   Treaty of Gandamak – Amir conduct his foreign policy with the advice of Government of India; a permanent British resident be stationed at Kabul.

#### **Freedom movement and further:**

-   Afghans support Indians during freedom struggle; the contribution of Khan Abdul Gaffar Khan, revered as Frontier Gandhi;
-   The first Indian Government-in-Exile was formed in Kabul by Maharaja Mahendra Pratap and Maulana Barkatullah.
-   In 1949, India concluded the Treaty of Friendship with India which opened up diplomatic relations.
-   During 1950s and ’60s, India developed its diplomatic proximity with Afghanistan.
-   India was among the first non-Communist states to recognize the government installed by the Soviet Union after its 1979\* invasion of Afghanistan.
-   New Delhi supported successive governments in Kabul until the rise of the Taliban in the 1990s.
-   But like most countries, India never recognized the Taliban’s assumption of power in 1996 (only Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates recognized the Taliban regime).
-   Following the 9/11 attacks and the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan that resulted, ties between India and Afghanistan grew strong once again.
-   India has restored full diplomatic relations, and has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid for Afghanistan’s reconstruction and development.
-   Traditionally, India as been in favour of democratically elected government in Afghanistan and has promoted its cause. India had argued that the Taliban are not elected and have no locus standi, as they do not represent the will of Afghan people.
-   That’s why India has called for “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned, and Afghan-controlled” process, with participation of the Afghanistan government.
-   India continued to build Afghan capacity for governance, security and development; also India has helped rural communities get schools, minor irrigation, health centres, and welfare for children and opportunities for women.



## GEO-STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE
-   Afghanistan enjoys a strategic location in South Asia and is particularly relevant to India as a geographical neighbour.
-   The country has the Central Asian Republics to the North, Pakistan to its East, and through Iran and Pakistan the Indian Ocean deeper south.
-   India’s first and most important interest in Afghanistan is to ensure that Pakistan does not gain an edge within governing structures of Afghanistan. India feels that if Pakistan succeeds in installing Taliban or a Taliban-sponsored regime in Afghanistan, it will be detrimental to the cause of the regional security of India.
-   For Indian trade with the Central Asian Republics, the flow could be through the sea lanes of communications of Indian Ocean to Gwadar port, and thereafter by land astride the Delaram highway that India has built-in Afghanistan, to destinations in CAR states.
-   A stable Afghanistan bordering India is crucial for regional and domestic security and stability in the South Asia and within India. Hardliners in Afghanistan have often been used by Pakistan to export terrorism in Kashmir.
-   A favourable Afghanistan is a sine-qua-non for accessing Central Asia and Eurasia by India through the Chabahar, which bypasses Pakistan.
-   Central Asia has large deposits of oil and natural gas. Afghanistan is an energy bridge and thus key to achieving India’s strategic objectives.
-   Huge deposits of energy raw materials and high-value mineral deposits. A substantial concentration of such resources is along Afghanistan’s borders with Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Iran, and Turkmenistan. Further, most Afghan resources remain untapped.
-   Afghanistan is of vital importance as a tool of counterbalance to Pakistan and China.
-   Afghanistan also denies strategic depth to Pakistan. The Pakistan-Afghanistan border remaining active denies Pakistan the opportunity of positioning additional military capabilities along its borders with India.

## Developmental partnership 

So far the Indian involvement in Afghanistan has been centered on the needs of the people of Afghanistan. These have been in consultation with Afghanistan’s elected government.

**Infrastructural development:**

-   Indians have constructed major projects like the Parliament Building in Kabul, the Zaranj Delaram highway project connecting western Afghanistan with the strategic Chabahar port in Iran and the Salma Dam Project (Afghan-India Friendship Dam) which includes a power transmission line.
-   Indian engineers are helping to construct the Shahtoot dam near Kabul
-   India has also signed a trilateral preferential trade agreement with Afghanistan and Iran.

**Military and administrative cooperation**

-   India is engaged in strengthening Afghan public institutions
-   Technical advisers, training for Afghan public servants, policemen and soldiers.
-   Supplying military hardware like military vehicles for the Afghan National Army and Mi-25 and Mi-35 choppers for the air force.

**Social development**

-   India has provided multiple scholarships to Afghan students
-   Providing vocational training and skill development classes to Afghan women and youth.
-   Afghanistan was among the first countries to receive anti Covid-19 vaccination from India.
-   India’s liberal visa policy has made it easier for Afghan patients to travel to India which has further enhanced people-to-people interaction between the two countries.

**People to people contact**

-   Indian cinema has a large market in Afghanistan.
-   India’s involvement and contribution to the development of cricket in Afghanistan has been one of its primary means of soft power influence in the nation.
