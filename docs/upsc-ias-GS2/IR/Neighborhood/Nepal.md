# India-Nepal relations
Nepal is the world’s 45th-biggest country in the world, with a population of 29 million people. Thus, if only for its size, Nepal is too big a nation-state to be a vassal. The country takes pride in its history of never having been colonized and has an important geostrategic position, with India and China on either side. However, contrary to conventional notions of a harmonious diplomatic relationship, there is a sharp difference in the way Nepal and India view each other.

HISTORICAL BACKGROUND

The relation between India and Nepal goes back to the times of rule of the Sakya clan and Gautama Buddha. Initially, Nepal was under tribal rule and only with the coming of Licchavi rule in Nepal did its feudal era truly begin.
From 750 to 1750 AD period saw a shift from Buddhism to Hinduism in Nepal and witnessed widespread cultural diffusion.
The early 1700s witnessed a change in the Nepalese power structure. The subsequent period witnesses both monarchical and prime ministerial rule. There established a dynastic rule for the Prime Minister, known as the “Rana”.
The Rana rule took hold and continued in Nepal till 1951.
In the 1920s, as the Indian freedom struggle progressed, many educated Nepalese people came to India and partook in the struggle. This gave the Nepalese elite an insight into nonviolent struggle.
The Nepali elite subsequently launched a movement in Nepal and succeeded in ousting the Rana rule.
The most instrumental role in this movement was played by the Nepali Congress (NC).
