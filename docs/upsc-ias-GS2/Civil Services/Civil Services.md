#  Civil service

In a democracy, the civil services play an extremely important role in the administration, policy formulation and implementation, and in taking the country forward towards progress and development.

Democracy is an egalitarian principle in which the governed elect the people who govern over them. There are three pillars of modern democracy:

1.  1.  Legislature
    2.  Executive
    3.  Judiciary

The civil services form a part of the executive. While the ministers, who are part of the executive, are temporary and are reelected or replaced by the people by their will (through elections), the civil servants are the permanent part of the executive.

-   The civil servants are accountable to the political executive, the ministers. The civil services are thus, a subdivision under the government.
-   The officers in the civil services form the permanent staff of the various governmental departments.
-   They are basically expert administrators.
-   They are sometimes referred to as the bureaucracy or also the public service.
-   The civil service is present all over India and it thus has a strong binding character.
-   It plays a vital role in effective policy-making and regulation.
-   It offers non-partisan advice to the political leadership of the country, even in the midst of political instability.
-   The service gives effective coordination between the various institutions of governance, and also between different departments, bodies, etc.
-   It offers service delivery and leadership at different levels of administration.
